Then I&rsquo;ll begin...<\/p><p>Long long ago, all the way back in 2011, a small company called Estate Apps was born. Full of promise and innovation, Estate Apps helped property professionals embrace new technology and showed them how it could benefit their business.<\/p><p>When the company began, Estate Apps was one of the first providers in the UK to offer native (iOS \/ Android) app solutions to the property industry. Even though since then many others have arrived, Estate Apps&rsquo; quality has shone through with their readiness to evolve and upgrade the service they provide.<\/p><p>As the years went on and the little app business grew, times began to change the market. Although apps were still a strong marketing tool, consumers were putting more focus on mobile websites and responsive technology. Taking the initiative Estate Apps leapt into action and came up with new cost-effective solutions to get every agent in the land mobile!<\/p><p>Since then, Estate Apps has provided dedicated mobile websites, responsive websites and apps to many agents, all over the UK. Praises of their services were sung far and wide, with agents writing testimonials for everyone to see.<\/p><p>As Estate Apps grows older they&rsquo;ll never forget their humble beginnings and that it&rsquo;s the agents that got them where they are today. With that firmly in mind, they ensure that the strong and personal service they&rsquo;ve always provided will continue from this day until their last.<\/p><p>That&rsquo;s the story so far, but new chapters are being added every day.

GDPR is coming into effect in May this year and it will affect your estate agency. We have written what GDPR is and what steps you can take now to help you when it is live.<\/p><p><strong>What is GDPR?<\/strong><\/p><p>GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation. It will supersede the Data Protection Act 1998 (DPA).<\/p><p><strong>What is the point of GDPR?<\/strong><\/p><p>The aim of GDPR is to protect all EU citizens&rsquo;* data. We live in a modern and digital society, so the data companies hold, in particular personal data in respect of GDPR, needs to protected and securely held.<\/p><p>GDPR is largely about consent - how you hold a client&rsquo;s data and what you&rsquo;re doing with it needs to be fully explained to them and positively agreed to by them.<\/p><p>* Yes we are involved in Brexit; No we don&rsquo;t entirely know what&rsquo;s happening there; Yes we are still in the EU; Yes you do need to be GDPR compliant; No you can&rsquo;t escape this.<\/p><p><strong>When does GDPR take effect?<\/strong><\/p><p>25th May 2018.<\/p><p>What if I leave it to April as I&rsquo;m too busy to deal with it now?<\/p><p>Don&rsquo;t leave it until April to sort it out! See point below. Most estate agencies don&rsquo;t have 250 employees where you can employ a Data Protection Officer (DPO) to assist your business, which means you have to do this yourself. If you customer list runs into its thousands, you need thousands of positive consents - so start now.<\/p><p><strong>How does this affect my estate agency?<\/strong><\/p><p>Massively. Non-compliance to GDPR carries a hefty fine - &pound;20 million or 4% of worldwide annual turnover. Below we have our top tips to help you get ready for 25th May 2018.<\/p><p>The fine isn&rsquo;t to scare you, but that&rsquo;s what it is and should spur you into action.<\/p><p><strong>Estate Apps&rsquo; top tips to help you get ready. <\/strong><\/p><p>Whilst it sounds complicated it isn&rsquo;t, however it does mean a review of your current processes and policies. We have provided our top tips to get you GDPR ready.<\/p><p>* Consider getting in a Data Protection Officer (DPO) if you have 250 or over employees. Although majority of estate agencies have less in which case you&rsquo;ll have to do the processes yourself. <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/for-organisations\/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr\">The ICO&rsquo;s website&nbsp;<\/a>is thoroughly comprehensive and has a <a href=\"https:\/\/ico.org.uk\/media\/1624219\/preparing-for-the-gdpr-12-steps.pdf\">12 step guide<\/a> to assist you.<\/p><p>* Preparation is a team effort. Get everyone in your business involved. Explain what GDPR is and how it affects property generally. Lead from the top. Please don&rsquo;t assume you can leave it to your administrator to sort out on their own. If there is a breach or non-compliance the whole business is culpable, not an individual.<\/p><p>* Undertake a data audit. This is important and the crux of getting your business ready:-<\/p><p>- Create a list, preferably in a spreadsheet with headings of all the data you hold for individuals such as first name, last name, email address, home address, work address. Whatever detail you hold against your customers put in the list.<\/p><p>- In property we take varying amounts of personal data, from email addresses, to current address, telephone details, copies of passport information. Any data that is personal to, say, an incoming tenant or buyer, that you hold needs to be accounted for in your data audit.<\/p><p>- If there is no reason for you to have this data remove it. For example, Mr Man has left Company X, you have no forwarding details; you&rsquo;re certain these details are old; you no longer need to keep in touch with them.<\/p><p>- Once you have your list, contact them. Whatever method you have chosen to create your list, whether on a spreadsheet or through your CRM, get in touch. (Tip: we have found using Mailchimp valuable). Your note has to be explicit in what you are intending to do with their email address (or whatever detail you hold) e.g please click this box to agree to be kept up-to-date with our services, receive property details, our newsletter etc. Do also note under GDPR you cannot have the box pre-ticked, default, to subscribe. You have to give the client the option.<\/p><p>- When you have positive consent, i.e yes I agree to you having my details so I can kept in touch with your services and marketing details, file it. Either save electronically or print and file. It&rsquo;s up to you. See following point.<\/p><p>- In respect of storing the data, being that many firms are now &lsquo;paperless&rsquo;, do be aware of where you save your client&rsquo;s personal information. If, for instance, you use cloud storage the server has to be in the EU. You will have to find a method that suits the way you work, whether that&rsquo;s storing via an external drive, the Cloud, paper and file, or all.<\/p><p>- Undertaking the data audit will mean you have an audit trail, i.e. you have proof of consent. So if you asked Mr Man of Company X, he&rsquo;s positively consented, he then receives an email of your latest properties, he asks why have you sent me this, he&rsquo;s forgotten he gave you permission, you can say &ldquo;you consented, here&rsquo;s the email, with date, time and IP address&rdquo;. Equally, if there are complaints to the ICO about a considerable number of marketing emails, for instance, coming from your firm the ICO are likely to investigate and will need to check your consents. Remember, you cannot make the client consent. If you do not have consent you cannot market to them.<\/p><p>- The revalidation of the list is probably the most concerning for everyone involved in property because most will be thinking there will be a reduction in their client mailing list. Whilst this may be true do think about it strategically. If you have an email marketing list and your open-rate is only 10-20%, consider whether the remainder is your target market that actually want to do business with you. Again, you cannot make the client consent to receiving your marketing details.<\/p><p>- Who in your firm has access to the client data? Staff members: what happens if\/when they leave? How long will the data be kept for? For example, once a tenant moves in, will you remove them from your list? We are in an age for desired transparency from businesses, GDPR&rsquo;s aim is to make the data kept transparent. If a consumer demands to know the details you have of them on file, they are well within their legal rights to access this.<\/p><p>* The privacy and cookies policy on your website will need looking into to. Again, ensure you are compliant. If you&rsquo;re asking for customer&rsquo;s details, be sure to state why you are asking for them.<\/p><p>We hope this has been of some help to you. GDPR is coming soon and whilst it may sound a bit scary, it really isn&rsquo;t. Preparation and action will ensure you are in a great position by 25th May.<\/p><p>These tips we&rsquo;ve provided are for guidance only, and not be considered legal advice. Whilst we are GDPR aware we urge you to visit the ICO&rsquo;s website for full disclosure of the steps to take to ensure complete compliance. If in doubt do call the ICO.<\/p>","link":null,"date":"2018-02-02 17:06:01","image":"5397491517850360.jpg","image_alt_tag":null,"meta_page_title":"How will GDPR affect Estate agents?

Facebook announced at their last f8 conference early last year upgrades to their messaging platform allowing for integrated bot and live chat into the site.<\/p><p>Now not everyone will be rushing towards this in 2018 as PropTech develops at the rate of a 1960&rsquo;s postal service but it certainly shines through the others and will make its mark. The added benefit is the lack of contact information needed to enter in.<\/p><p>Bots don&rsquo;t have a place for replacing live chat but I really hope to see instant valuations turn over to this side and utilise that shared user data to provide a better experience. Less forms, more results.<\/p><h3><strong>Stock imagery that isn&rsquo;t the same as your neighbour<\/strong><\/h3><p>This one has a tiny place in my heart. Stock imagery went through a great phase last year of killing off terrible old cliche photos with a whole new brilliant range from talented worldwide photographers and I loved it. I had access to good photographic content and saw quite a few sites that didn&rsquo;t have the same quality of photos produce fantastic looking marketing and websites.<\/p><p>A year on though and already I&rsquo;ve started to see the same photos being used over and over again as if people got lazy and instead of working towards producing their own unique content, just left it with the stock ones.<\/p><p>So great, we&rsquo;re back here again. Everything looks the same.<\/p><p>As the cycle goes, the breaking point will again be this year where I start seeing agents care that little bit more about the photography and sites pop out with beautiful looking content that is unique to them.<\/p><p>I already starting to see more video content being produced on the latter end so that will definitely keep pushing forward as well.<\/p><h3><strong>Software that removes the admin<\/strong><\/h3><p>Last year was another step in growth from 2016 on new start up softwares and we saw more integration problems being thought about and solved.<\/p><p>I fully expect to see some of the bigger players in property software reevaluate their own software and offer more integration after two years of solid software growth. Actually solving admin task and letting their clients get on with the job in-hand.<\/p><p>No longer do we have to export that list and copy it to a different format and import it over there. Stuff just works and when it does, it&rsquo;s simply magical.<\/p><h3><strong>Sites with Character<\/strong><\/h3><p>Template sites have seen quite the growth last year but they get stale very quickly.<\/p><p>With browser support keeping up, and yes even Microsoft&#39;s Edge, with frontend code, designers can play so much more. Not even just responsive sites but ones that give you that unique branded experience with colour and imagery and movement like no other.<\/p><p>Template sites will be freshened up and custom ones will be even better than last year.<\/p><h3><strong>Rightmove announces their own branded phone<\/strong><\/h3><p>Rightmove&rsquo;s dominance last year hasn&rsquo;t surprised me at all, I&rsquo;ve got my fingers crossed on this one that they&rsquo;ll go full Microsoft \/ Apple \/ Samsung \/ Google and just launch a property phone because we don&rsquo;t have enough new phones coming out to deal with the demand for housing.

It will be interesting to see how it is used by not only agents but clients too.<\/p><p>I expect to see more businesses adapting to virtual and augmented reality and using it for their digital marketing campaigns this year. Advertising campaigns will be consumed through VR headsets and also within computer-generated sensory inputs such as sound, video or graphics (augmented reality).<\/p><p>We will start to see more estate agents use virtual reality and more for selling properties, its ability to provide a full insights and allow buyers to view multiple homes without even leaving the agent&rsquo;s office is something that could appeal to home-buyers.

Website loading speed is one of the very important factors for ranking, helping you to reduce your bounce rate as well as keeping your visitors to stay for a long time on your website. Not only does it affect your rankings, it&rsquo;s also a major UX (user experience) factor, with Google expecting pages to load in under three seconds, this year should see more and more businesses trying to improve their site loading speed, if not, expect to lose more potential customer than ever. It is essentially the survival of the fastest!<\/p><p>I expect long tail keywords to play a bigger role in search engine rankings this year. Short team keywords are so fierce in competition and while they do help you achieve page 1, the traffic will be more quantity than quality, a big difference. For instance, if you type in &lsquo;digital marketing company&rsquo; for a specific industry and your website comes up, you&rsquo;re likely to get people coming into your website who are attracted to digital marketing but not necessarily interested in your area of expertise.<\/p><p>This is where the power of long tail keywords come into action, a long tail keyword such as &lsquo;digital marketing for estate agents&rsquo; will bring you more relevant traffic. Ranking higher for long tail keywords is much easier due to less competition, i think we&rsquo;ll see more companies using long tail keywords to gain more relevant traffic to their site.<\/p><p>Last prediction for me is the rise of smart homes. There will be a rise in the availability of &lsquo;smart homes&rsquo; or homes where the heating, lighting and ventilation system can be controlled remotely with a device, or even with a voice recognition system. In addition to this, more smart gadgets will be used for homes with LG having already introduced new refrigerators with Amazon&#39;s Alexa voice assistant built in.

Not only that, Stories daily views blew past Snapchat&rsquo;s amassing 20 million daily views in its first year. It is estimated by the end of 2018 more than half of Instagram&rsquo;s users, currently at 700 million, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/chart\/9086\/daily-active-users-instagram-stories-snapchat\/\">will be using Stories<\/a>.<\/p><p>Whether you&rsquo;re B2B or B2C Instagram is a great way to show your company culture to your audience, almost like a &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; scenario, particularly if you&rsquo;re in an office service based industry. Instagram Stories are fun and again demonstrates more of your business&rsquo; personality and brand, which can be difficult if your business sits behind the screen - but don&rsquo;t let that stop you, get creative, use hashtags, add your location. The great thing about Stories is that they&rsquo;re discoverable, so your audience is actually wider than your actual followers.<\/p><p>The engagement goldmine Stories has is the very premise of its beginnings - video, which far out performs <a href=\"https:\/\/estateapps.co.uk\/blog\/the-rise-of-video-content-and-its-importance-for-businesses\">other content on social media<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>2. Live Streaming<\/p><p>Facebook, Instagram (via Stories), Twitter (via Periscope) and YouTube has a &lsquo;live&rsquo; streaming feature*. This is going to be major from brands and businesses who want to take the time to understand the strategy of &lsquo;going live&rsquo;. Live streaming isn&rsquo;t exactly new, but how it is being used is changing. More importantly, what makes live streaming so accessible is the hardware we use. We tend to have the latest smartphones with the most astounding tech capabilities and processing speeds which means the videos we take are now much less grainy and offer seriously good quality. Smartphones now operate 4G, the next few years will be telling for live streaming when 5G will become the standard.<\/p><p>*Video has only recently arrived on LinkedIn personal profiles, and as of writing not yet on company pages. It would be interesting if LinkedIn adopt a live streaming feature.<\/p><p>3. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality<\/p><p>We know to most this may sound like some dark art tech wizardry, but really it isn&rsquo;t. When it comes to social media it&rsquo;s new-ish, you recall Pokemon Go? Well soon it will be like that on major social networks. Snapchat have already <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wired.co.uk\/article\/snapchats-letting-you-send-your-own-bitmoji\">partnered with Bitmoji<\/a>&nbsp;which is basically your own personal expressive emoji. Facebook owns Oculus and is understood to be working on<a href=\"https:\/\/www.oculus.com\/experiences\/rift\/1036793313023466\/\"> virtual hangout Spaces<\/a>.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As social networks partner with AR and VR companies it is going to be exciting how this pans for businesses interested in the take up. You can see how a new sofa will look in your home before buying. Google Glass attempted to revolutionise the public space with augmented reality, however, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2014\/jun\/09\/diane-von-furstenberg-google-glass-net-a-porter\u00a0\">other than DVF<\/a> herself the take up wasn&rsquo;t great. Perhaps it was ahead of its time? But now is the time for Google to put their augmented hat back in the ring and play ball. The property market alone would highly benefit from this form of tech, think how inspections could go. Awesome.<\/p><p>4. Ad growth<\/p><p>In order to stay relevant, and compete, in a seemingly saturated social media market and cut through the clutter, businesses and brands will have to invest in the route of placing adverts. This would require strategic planning, whether it&rsquo;s to get audiences to follow your Instagram page or direct them to a lead magnet by producing a relevant video ad or a how-to infographic, how you get their attention is going to call on your creativity.<\/p><p>Something to note, which you may have missed, in December Facebook announced it would be coming down on posts that say &lsquo;vote here&rsquo;, &lsquo;click this&rsquo;, &lsquo;hit like&rsquo; or &lsquo;share this&rsquo; etc as they regard it as engagement bait. If you think by not spending on ads and putting these terms to get audience engagement on your posts, think again! Your posts will be demoted down the newsfeed - so don&rsquo;t do it.<\/p><p>5. Generation Z<\/p><p>Who? I hear you ask. Gen Z is the millenial&rsquo;s sibling. Born in the late &lsquo;90s, early &lsquo;00s, they are the first generation to grow up 100% online, with the oldest being 22 years old. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.goldmansachs.com\/our-thinking\/pages\/macroeconomic-insights-folder\/what-if-i-told-you\/report.pdf\u00a0\">Research<\/a> has shown Gen Z will have more influence and buying power than the older millenial; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.retaildive.com\/news\/gen-z-twice-as-influenced-by-social-media-as-by-deals\/505274\">RetailDive<\/a>&nbsp;says: &ldquo;Gen Z is two to three times more likely to be influenced by social media than by sales or discounts &mdash; the only generation to value social media over price when it comes to making purchase decisions&rdquo;. So if your brand is Gen Z friendly, you&rsquo;ll need to adopt a social strategy that takes your audience into account.<\/p><p>A bonus point to note is Twitter. Most don&rsquo;t really know how or why the network is still around, with a dwindling audience of 330m monthly active users and an over-active American President persistently offending the world (it seems), eyes are on Jack Dorsey as to his next move. 280 characters was met with divided opinion on launch, but most seem to now have accepted this change. The question is what next Jack?<\/p><p>In a social media world of constant change it&rsquo;s going to be very interesting to see what this year brings to the mediums that seemingly unite brands and businesses to their audiences.<\/p><p>Next up is&nbsp;Sam with his predictions for the year!&nbsp;<\/p>","link":null,"date":"2018-01-18 11:37:35","image":"8839121516378995.jpg","image_alt_tag":null,"meta_page_title":"Estate Apps digital predictions for this year ","meta_page_description":"Kat Sonson, content writer for Estate Apps gives her social media predictions for the year ","tags":"Social-Media","video_url":null,"slug":"estate-apps-digital-predictions-for-2018-kat","author":{"firstname":"Kat","surname":"Sonson","image":"279_Kat_Sonson_110477.jpg","position":null,"bio":"","website_url":null,"linkedin_url":null,"twitter_url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/KatSonson"}},{"id":"19000","type":"Public","title":"Estate Apps Digital Predictions for 2018 (Sam)","content":"<p>Sam Johns ( Sales and Marketing manager)<\/p><p>This is somewhat of a cop-out prediction because we *know* GDPR will be making a big change this year.

Whether you bake cakes or sell homes, your website needs to demonstrate what your business does and how you can meet the needs of your online audience.<\/p><p>Without trying to teach you to suck eggs, your website needs to be accessible 24\/7 and be viewed on a mobile or desktop computer. Your website is the door to your business, are you going to leave the door ajar, or welcome visitors with tea and biscuits? In this blog we provide you with our 10 top tips to ensure clients will want to stay on your website and have a look around.<\/p><ol>\t<li>\t<p>What you do: this sounds simple, but there are websites that basically say &ldquo;Hello, we&rsquo;re Smith &amp; Smith here are some pretty pictures to take up web space&rdquo;, and include photos that are not related to the business (more on that later). Clearly show what your company does in a few short words that will grab the reader&rsquo;s attention and keep them interested in you. Think of your recent elevator pitch, or you ten word top line. If you&rsquo;re describing your company in novel terms, you are likely to have lost your reader before the end of the first paragraph.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Links to social media: whatever social media platform your company uses, make sure they&rsquo;re prominent and also in the &lsquo;contact info&rsquo; (see point 4). Whilst your website is generally quite static, your social media will portray the more fluid side of your business as this is (and should be) constantly updated.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Easy navigation: what can irritate your visitors is the inability to get around your website easily. Imagine having visitors to your home, as they enter they have to jump hurdles and belly dance a low hanging beam in order to get to another room - get the picture? Ensure your menu buttons are clear, also include a site map as this will help your visitors find their way. A site map will greatly help with SEO as it will tell search engines how your pages are linked.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Contact information - make it easy for customers to get in touch. This is vital in terms of Call to Action. If there&rsquo;s a property they&rsquo;ve seen on your website and would like to view, how can they get in touch? Don&rsquo;t forget to include all contact details, office telephone number and social media handles. If your shop or estate agency is open Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm, how else can your visitor get in touch outside of these hours i.e email, chat form or tweet you.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Client testimonials - this builds credibility for your business. It&rsquo;s worth noting people buy from people &lt;link to previous blog&gt; and much like word-of-mouth recommendation, a testimonial from previous clients are just as impactful.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>High quality images - it will do your credibility no good if the pictures you put up a blurry and pixelated. Including stock imagery is ok, but the best images are those that are high resolution and real. How about including pictures of your office or your team? If you&rsquo;re showing visitors pictures of properties to rent, it would be essential for you to provide good, clean imagery - give the visitor something to ponder on, not think &lsquo;what am I looking at, it&rsquo;s so blurry&hellip;.&rsquo; get the picture (literally).<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Overview of your services - akin to point 1 above, if your business offers more than website design, say so; if you&rsquo;re an estate agency that deals in renting as well as buying, say so. Perhaps you&rsquo;re a one-stop-shop chartered surveying practice dealing with investments to lease advisory, say so. Don&rsquo;t leave your visitor guessing what your services could be.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Clear call to action - whether it&rsquo;s to download property details, call you to make a viewing or buy from you, make this clear with a prominent &ldquo;Buy now&rdquo;, &ldquo;Request for Quote&rdquo;.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Your logo and branding - this goes without saying really, however this point can be easily missed. Your logo may be the smallest content on the webpage, but it needs to be repeated consistently on all pages - remind visitors where they are, make your logo memorable. Additionally with your branding, do you have a corporate tone-of-voice in your blogs but the rest of website speaks like you&rsquo;re talking with a friend, or a different typeface on one page to the next? Again, ensure your branding is consistent with your business to make sure you stand out.<\/p>\t<\/li>\t<li>\t<p>Fresh and original content - Primarily for your ranking on the search engine results pages, you ought to make it a point to make sure the content on your website is updated regularly. Do you have comments on the recent budget, for example, that is relevant to your business? Include these in a blog section with the relevant keywords to ensure you are able to rank higher on the search engine pages. &nbsp;<\/p>\t<\/li><\/ol><p>Bonus tip&nbsp;- use video: did you know, if you include video on a landing page increases conversions by 80% woah! We understand it isn&rsquo;t suitable for all businesses with varying budgets, however if you can - do it. Your visitors are likely to be engaged in your website that much longer.<\/p><p>We hope you found this article useful, perhaps there is something you would add or take off the list?

Wrong. Well you&rsquo;re not totally wrong. Branding is more than hiring a graphic designer to think of marketing your business via a logo. In this article we want to show why the importance of online branding is a major factor for your business.<\/p><p>Your brand is the public face and personality of your business. In the offline world, your business&rsquo; presence is kept alive, say, as an estate agency on the local high street, 9-5. Whereas online you exist 24\/7 via your website and social channels. How you represent yourself to the potential buyers, sellers, tenants and landlords is in the same way you need to appear online. How you pick up the phone and take enquiries is the same way you need to reply via your webchat and social media channels. Further, how you demonstrate your expertise in buying, selling and letting properties in your local area to those who walk through your door is the same way you need communicate through your blogs and email newsletter.<\/p><p>How do you demonstrate your brand online?<\/p><p>The short answer to this question is through two major elements in your business&rsquo; marketing strategy: consistency and content.The longer answer: Your branding online is a representation of your business, it is your present reputation and how you will be perceived going forward. So let&rsquo;s start with your logo.<\/p><p>You want your &nbsp;logo to be a visual representation of how you stand out from the crowd. There are numerous articles on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.colorpsychology.org\/color-psychology-marketing\/\">colour psychology in marketing<\/a>&nbsp;which are very helpful. A good graphic designer can discuss in depth with you your vision and core business values, and then translate that graphically.<\/p><p>Once your logo has been designed, it needs to be everywhere, consistently, online. Think wherever your name is, your logo will be there too. The same logo on your Twitter needs to be the same on your Facebook Page. This consistency will make your memorable to your audience. Also your logo needs to be equally prominent on your website, email newsletters and in any pdf downloads.<\/p><p>In tandem with consistency of display of your logo, is your business&rsquo; tone of voice. This needs to match online just how you would communicate offline. If you have a corporate, overly professional tone in your email newsletters, but you answer your phone calls as if you&rsquo;re talking to a mate, you may confuse your audience. So remember these lines of communication need to marry. Your audience wants to relate on your email, just as you are when you speak or meet face-to-face. For example, if you&rsquo;ve sent a newsletter mailshot to your leads and a potential new client decides to book in a home valuation, essentially they&rsquo;ll want the same person on email as they want valuing their home.<\/p><p>In a digital age where consumer demand for transparency is so high, your branding online has to speak volumes. So the other important element in branding is your content output. Not necessarily the quantity, but definitely the quality of your content is of great significance. The content your create and promote online should demonstrate your expertise and the value your business offers to your audience. By devising and implementing your content strategy across all platforms and online material you will ensure the same, consistent, message is delivered on all outlets. <a href=\"https:\/\/rebekahradice.com\/content-strategy-need-create-personal-brand\/\">Rebekah Radice<\/a>&nbsp;says: &ldquo;Good content can open doors to new conversations as well as boost engagement and awareness&rdquo;. &nbsp;If you&rsquo;re passionate about property, what value can you offer to potential clients. Perhaps it&rsquo;s by way of a pdf download on top tips to sell your home in Spring; or a video on how to prepare your home for viewings. What does your estate agency do that another agency doesn&rsquo;t?<\/p><p>One of the forgotten elements in digital content and online branding is remembering to humanise the online, that is - make it real, authentic and emphatic. Just because you&rsquo;re viewed through a computer or mobile screen, doesn&rsquo;t make your business any less real. So put some soul into your social, create your content to ensure it sounds like you so your audience can relate with what you&rsquo;re saying. With so many businesses offering similar services, it&rsquo;s the difference you make that will will ensure you stand out.<\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.strong-content.com\/brand-consistency-social-media-critical-customers\/\">Research has shown&nbsp;<\/a>that businesses consider having a bad reputation online to be a primary concern. If you think how quickly bad news travels today - remember that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/us-news\/2017\/apr\/10\/united-airlines-video-passenger-removed-overbooked-flight\">United Airlines video<\/a>, then the CEO speech that followed? Both were PR disasters for United, for which they were punished by the public furore with the slew of Twitter outrage. A bad reputation is hard to fix when a video (or any post for that matter) goes viral. We hope you and your business would never, ever, be subject to anything of the sort, however if there is a client complaint online, just as you would sort it out quickly (we hope) face-to-face, do it online too. Carry the same tone of voice as you would face-to-face. A lot of comments online are made publicly, therefore your response would also need to be public to ensure any &lsquo;onlookers&rsquo; can see how you handle any on-going commentary. It may be a &ldquo;please can you DM me your number so I can call you&rdquo;, but at least you reply promptly.<\/p><p>Your reputation in business will precede you, so let your branding through consistent content creation lead the way for you.

In terms of content creation, video is in the high echelons of royalty that&#39;s for sure. We have produced an infographic to highlight some of the interesting statistics of using video on the web and social media.<\/em><\/p><p><br \/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http:\/\/appmanager.co.uk\/cloud\/frontend\/web\/image\/view\/local\/279-1512401943-869410.png\" style=\"height:600px; width:400px\" \/><\/p><p>It&rsquo;s very clear video views on mobile and desktop are rising each year. As Facebook adds to its number of users, already into it second billion, it stands to reason the number of videos will creep upwards too, and at 100 million video views per day, that&rsquo;s already a stupefying stat! In turn, the &#39;How-To&#39; searches on YouTube offer the practical value of video content - seeing something in motion speeds the process of learning, rather than just by reading. Additionally, when attaching video content to your social media posts it will enable your audience to engage with your content in some way, which is valuable because once your video makes an impression (literally) on your audience&#39;s timeline, you are 10 times more likely to get either a comment, like or share. Side note: engagement is the quality metric you should be seeking over quantity of followers or post output.<br \/><br \/>How can the stats outlined in our infographic apply to your business?<br \/><br \/>As YouTube have said, the general video and &#39;how-to&#39; consumption increases each year so it&rsquo;s important to know how your business can ride the crest of this wave. Ask yourself how can you show what your clients need to know. YouTube is number one for &#39;how-to&#39;; so if you&#39;re an estate agency - what do your clients need to know when selling their home - perhaps you could offer your top five tips like bright lighting in rooms. Or if you&#39;re a gardener, what top tips can you show wannabe gardeners to maintain they garden in the autumn\/winter season. The key takeaway is to offer <strong>value<\/strong> to your niche audience i.e buyers, sellers, tenants, landlords or avid gardeners. What are they searching for online? Don&#39;t sell to them. Selling on video is a bit like shouting - your audience won&#39;t listen to you if you&rsquo;re ramming properties all over their laptop or mobile screen, but if you let them know the details in what potential vendors look for when buying, then you&#39;re on a home run (we recently read that the smell of home-baked bread was a neat trick - let us know if that works!)<br \/><br \/>The great thing about video content creation is you&#39;re then able to repurpose this content across your other social media platforms or email list. For example if you create a video on how to maintain your garden during the autumn season, you can add this link into your email, take a quote from your video and send on to your email list. The great stat about adding a video link to your email is that there is a 200-300% increase in click-through rates. This will do wonders for your website stats. You can also repurpose the video content further to your social media channels, for example a snippet of the video to your Instagram and Twitter, with a link to your website.<br \/><br \/>The stats show that the rise of video content is in orbit at the moment and steadily rocketing. The negative feedback is that creating video is time consuming and technical. This can be true. But it really depends on what you are sharing. For example with how-to&#39;s and a home property tour they can be created on a limited budget, with just a smartphone and a steady hand. If you are filming promotional content for, say, your company website it would be best to seek a videographer.<br \/><br \/>Video content strategy<br \/><br \/>When you have decided on the type of video content you want to share, it is important that you keep to a schedule. If you decide to do a &lsquo;how-to&rsquo;, how often are you going to be able to offer these? If you say you&#39;ll do your how-to&#39;s every Monday, you have the remainder of the week to edit, issue in final form and promote. Then prepare for the next one. You have to be realistic with your timescale. To be super-organised it&#39;s best you give yourself enough lead time, so create a few videos first before you say you&#39;re going to &#39;launch&#39; your how-to&#39;s, otherwise you will find yourself chasing your tail and under pressure. Organise a calendar with the content you want to share with your clientele, then you can visually see and map your time. The calendar can be your work calendar, a spreadsheet or a tool like Asana or Slack - find what works for you and your team. Keep in mind &lsquo;awareness&rsquo; days that you could build your content around such as National Home Security Month is in October, or even if an awareness day is noted globally you may need to pause your video schedule for the day as your content may get lost in the support of the awareness day.<\/p><p>Bonus stats<\/p><p>We are awed by these video stats and thought you might be too - so as a bonus we&rsquo;ve added a few more:<\/p><ul>\t<li>Including video on a landing page can increase conversions by 80%<\/li>\t<li>Between Snapchat (10 billion), Facebook (8 billion) and YouTube (4 billion) there are 22 billion daily views<\/li>\t<li>When you use video, you are 53 times more likely to rank on the first page of Google<\/li><\/ul><p>We hope you found this blog useful, and if you do please let us know your comments or share with the links below.

 * The above creates an instance of minErr in the example namespace. The

 * are applied with respect to how minErr instances are created and called.
 * Instances should have names of the form namespaceMinErr for a minErr created
 * using minErr('namespace') . Error codes, namespaces and template strings
 * should all be static strings, not variables or general expressions.

 * @element ANY
 * @param {angular.Module} ngApp an optional application
 *   {@link angular.module module} name to load.
 * @param {boolean=} ngStrictDi if this attribute is present on the app element, the injector will be
 *   created in "strict-di" mode. This means that the application will fail to invoke functions which

 *
 * @description
 *
 * Use this directive to **auto-bootstrap** an AngularJS application. The `ngApp` directive
 * designates the **root element** of the application and is typically placed near the root element
 * of the page - e.g. on the `<body>` or `<html>` tags.
 *
 * There are a few things to keep in mind when using `ngApp`:
 * - only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document. The first `ngApp`
 *   found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an
 *   application. To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using
 *   {@link angular.bootstrap} instead.
 * - AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
 * - Do not use a directive that uses {@link ng.$compile#transclusion transclusion} on the same element as `ngApp`.
 *   This includes directives such as {@link ng.ngIf `ngIf`}, {@link ng.ngInclude `ngInclude`} and
 *   {@link ngRoute.ngView `ngView`}.
 *   Doing this misplaces the app {@link ng.$rootElement `$rootElement`} and the app's {@link auto.$injector injector},
 *   causing animations to stop working and making the injector inaccessible from outside the app.
 *
 * You can specify an **AngularJS module** to be used as the root module for the application.  This
 * module will be loaded into the {@link auto.$injector} when the application is bootstrapped. It
 * should contain the application code needed or have dependencies on other modules that will
 * contain the code. See {@link angular.module} for more information.
 *
 * In the example below if the `ngApp` directive were not placed on the `html` element then the
 * document would not be compiled, the `AppController` would not be instantiated and the `{{ a+b }}`
 * would not be resolved to `3`.
 *
 * `ngApp` is the easiest, and most common way to bootstrap an application.
 *
 <example module="ngAppDemo" name="ng-app">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-controller="ngAppDemoController">
     I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}
   </div>
   </file>
   <file name="script.js">
   angular.module('ngAppDemo', []).controller('ngAppDemoController', function($scope) {
     $scope.a = 1;
     $scope.b = 2;
   });
   </file>
 </example>
 *
 * Using `ngStrictDi`, you would see something like this:
 *
 <example ng-app-included="true" name="strict-di">
   <file name="index.html">
   <div ng-app="ngAppStrictDemo" ng-strict-di>
       <div ng-controller="GoodController1">
           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style (see
              script.js for details)
           </p>
       </div>

       <div ng-controller="GoodController2">
           Name: <input ng-model="name"><br />
           Hello, {{name}}!

           <p>This renders because the controller does not fail to
              instantiate, by using explicit annotation style
              (see script.js for details)
           </p>
       </div>

       <div ng-controller="BadController">
           I can add: {{a}} + {{b}} =  {{ a+b }}

           <p>The controller could not be instantiated, due to relying
              on automatic function annotations (which are disabled in
              strict mode). As such, the content of this section is not

/**
 * @ngdoc function
 * @name angular.element
 * @module ng
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Wraps a raw DOM element or HTML string as a [jQuery](http://jquery.com) element.
 *
 * If jQuery is available, `angular.element` is an alias for the
 * [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/) function. If jQuery is not available, `angular.element`
 * delegates to Angular's built-in subset of jQuery, called "jQuery lite" or **jqLite**.
 *
 * jqLite is a tiny, API-compatible subset of jQuery that allows
 * Angular to manipulate the DOM in a cross-browser compatible way. jqLite implements only the most
 * commonly needed functionality with the goal of having a very small footprint.
 *
 * To use `jQuery`, simply ensure it is loaded before the `angular.js` file. You can also use the
 * {@link ngJq `ngJq`} directive to specify that jqlite should be used over jQuery, or to use a
 * specific version of jQuery if multiple versions exist on the page.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">**Note:** All element references in Angular are always wrapped with jQuery or
 * jqLite (such as the element argument in a directive's compile / link function). They are never raw DOM references.</div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">**Note:** Keep in mind that this function will not find elements
 * by tag name / CSS selector. For lookups by tag name, try instead `angular.element(document).find(...)`
 * or `$document.find()`, or use the standard DOM APIs, e.g. `document.querySelectorAll()`.</div>
 *
 * ## Angular's jqLite
 * jqLite provides only the following jQuery methods:
 *
 * - [`addClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/addClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument
 * - [`after()`](http://api.jquery.com/after/)
 * - [`append()`](http://api.jquery.com/append/)
 * - [`attr()`](http://api.jquery.com/attr/) - Does not support functions as parameters
 * - [`bind()`](http://api.jquery.com/bind/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`children()`](http://api.jquery.com/children/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`clone()`](http://api.jquery.com/clone/)
 * - [`contents()`](http://api.jquery.com/contents/)
 * - [`css()`](http://api.jquery.com/css/) - Only retrieves inline-styles, does not call `getComputedStyle()`.
 *   As a setter, does not convert numbers to strings or append 'px', and also does not have automatic property prefixing.
 * - [`data()`](http://api.jquery.com/data/)
 * - [`detach()`](http://api.jquery.com/detach/)
 * - [`empty()`](http://api.jquery.com/empty/)
 * - [`eq()`](http://api.jquery.com/eq/)
 * - [`find()`](http://api.jquery.com/find/) - Limited to lookups by tag name
 * - [`hasClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/)
 * - [`html()`](http://api.jquery.com/html/)
 * - [`next()`](http://api.jquery.com/next/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`on()`](http://api.jquery.com/on/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or eventData
 * - [`off()`](http://api.jquery.com/off/) - Does not support namespaces, selectors or event object as parameter
 * - [`one()`](http://api.jquery.com/one/) - Does not support namespaces or selectors
 * - [`parent()`](http://api.jquery.com/parent/) - Does not support selectors
 * - [`prepend()`](http://api.jquery.com/prepend/)
 * - [`prop()`](http://api.jquery.com/prop/)
 * - [`ready()`](http://api.jquery.com/ready/)
 * - [`remove()`](http://api.jquery.com/remove/)
 * - [`removeAttr()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/) - Does not support multiple attributes
 * - [`removeClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument
 * - [`removeData()`](http://api.jquery.com/removeData/)
 * - [`replaceWith()`](http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/)
 * - [`text()`](http://api.jquery.com/text/)
 * - [`toggleClass()`](http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/) - Does not support a function as first argument
 * - [`triggerHandler()`](http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/) - Passes a dummy event object to handlers
 * - [`unbind()`](http://api.jquery.com/unbind/) - Does not support namespaces or event object as parameter
 * - [`val()`](http://api.jquery.com/val/)
 * - [`wrap()`](http://api.jquery.com/wrap/)
 *
 * ## jQuery/jqLite Extras
 * Angular also provides the following additional methods and events to both jQuery and jqLite:
 *
 * ### Events
 * - `$destroy` - AngularJS intercepts all jqLite/jQuery's DOM destruction apis and fires this event
 *    on all DOM nodes being removed.  This can be used to clean up any 3rd party bindings to the DOM
 *    element before it is removed.
 *
 * ### Methods
 * - `controller(name)` - retrieves the controller of the current element or its parent. By default
 *   retrieves controller associated with the `ngController` directive. If `name` is provided as
 *   camelCase directive name, then the controller for this directive will be retrieved (e.g.
 *   `'ngModel'`).
 * - `injector()` - retrieves the injector of the current element or its parent.
 * - `scope()` - retrieves the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} of the current
 *   element or its parent. Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to
 *   be enabled.
 * - `isolateScope()` - retrieves an isolate {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope scope} if one is attached directly to the
 *   current element. This getter should be used only on elements that contain a directive which starts a new isolate
 *   scope. Calling `scope()` on this element always returns the original non-isolate scope.
 *   Requires {@link guide/production#disabling-debug-data Debug Data} to be enabled.
 * - `inheritedData()` - same as `data()`, but walks up the DOM until a value is found or the top
 *   parent element is reached.
 *
 * @knownIssue You cannot spy on `angular.element` if you are using Jasmine version 1.x. See
 * https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/14251 for more information.
 *
 * @param {string|DOMElement} element HTML string or DOMElement to be wrapped into jQuery.
 * @returns {Object} jQuery object.

 * Creates an injector object that can be used for retrieving services as well as for
 * dependency injection (see {@link guide/di dependency injection}).
 *
 * @param {Array.<string|Function>} modules A list of module functions or their aliases. See
 *     {@link angular.module}. The `ng` module must be explicitly added.
 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Whether the injector should be in strict mode, which

 * @returns {injector} Injector object. See {@link auto.$injector $injector}.
 *
 * @example
 * Typical usage
 * ```js
 *   // create an injector
 *   var $injector = angular.injector(['ng']);
 *
 *   // use the injector to kick off your application
 *   // use the type inference to auto inject arguments, or use implicit injection
 *   $injector.invoke(function($rootScope, $compile, $document) {
 *     $compile($document)($rootScope);
 *     $rootScope.$digest();
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Sometimes you want to get access to the injector of a currently running Angular app
 * from outside Angular. Perhaps, you want to inject and compile some markup after the
 * application has been bootstrapped. You can do this using the extra `injector()` added
 * to JQuery/jqLite elements. See {@link angular.element}.
 *
 * *This is fairly rare but could be the case if a third party library is injecting the
 * markup.*
 *
 * In the following example a new block of HTML containing a `ng-controller`
 * directive is added to the end of the document body by JQuery. We then compile and link
 * it into the current AngularJS scope.
 *
 * ```js
 * var $div = $('<div ng-controller="MyCtrl">{{content.label}}</div>');
 * $(document.body).append($div);
 *
 * angular.element(document).injector().invoke(function($compile) {
 *   var scope = angular.element($div).scope();
 *   $compile($div)(scope);

 * # Injection Function Annotation
 *
 * JavaScript does not have annotations, and annotations are needed for dependency injection. The
 * following are all valid ways of annotating function with injection arguments and are equivalent.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // inferred (only works if code not minified/obfuscated)
 *   $injector.invoke(function(serviceA){});
 *
 *   // annotated
 *   function explicit(serviceA) {};
 *   explicit.$inject = ['serviceA'];
 *   $injector.invoke(explicit);
 *
 *   // inline
 *   $injector.invoke(['serviceA', function(serviceA){}]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Inference
 *
 * In JavaScript calling `toString()` on a function returns the function definition. The definition
 * can then be parsed and the function arguments can be extracted. This method of discovering
 * annotations is disallowed when the injector is in strict mode.
 * *NOTE:* This does not work with minification, and obfuscation tools since these tools change the
 * argument names.

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $injector#annotate
 *
 * @description
 * Returns an array of service names which the function is requesting for injection. This API is
 * used by the injector to determine which services need to be injected into the function when the
 * function is invoked. There are three ways in which the function can be annotated with the needed
 * dependencies.
 *
 * # Argument names
 *
 * The simplest form is to extract the dependencies from the arguments of the function. This is done
 * by converting the function into a string using `toString()` method and extracting the argument
 * names.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   function MyController($scope, $route) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * You can disallow this method by using strict injection mode.
 *
 * This method does not work with code minification / obfuscation. For this reason the following
 * annotation strategies are supported.
 *
 * # The `$inject` property
 *
 * If a function has an `$inject` property and its value is an array of strings, then the strings
 * represent names of services to be injected into the function.
 * ```js
 *   // Given
 *   var MyController = function(obfuscatedScope, obfuscatedRoute) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *   // Define function dependencies
 *   MyController['$inject'] = ['$scope', '$route'];
 *
 *   // Then
 *   expect(injector.annotate(MyController)).toEqual(['$scope', '$route']);
 * ```
 *
 * # The array notation
 *
 * It is often desirable to inline Injected functions and that's when setting the `$inject` property
 * is very inconvenient. In these situations using the array notation to specify the dependencies in
 * a way that survives minification is a better choice:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // We wish to write this (not minification / obfuscation safe)
 *   injector.invoke(function($compile, $rootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   });
 *
 *   // We are forced to write break inlining
 *   var tmpFn = function(obfuscatedCompile, obfuscatedRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   };
 *   tmpFn.$inject = ['$compile', '$rootScope'];
 *   injector.invoke(tmpFn);
 *
 *   // To better support inline function the inline annotation is supported
 *   injector.invoke(['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfCompile, obfRootScope) {
 *     // ...
 *   }]);
 *
 *   // Therefore
 *   expect(injector.annotate(
 *      ['$compile', '$rootScope', function(obfus_$compile, obfus_$rootScope) {}])
 *    ).toEqual(['$compile', '$rootScope']);
 * ```
 *
 * @param {Function|Array.<string|Function>} fn Function for which dependent service names need to
 * be retrieved as described above.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} [strictDi=false] Disallow argument name annotation inference.
 *
 * @returns {Array.<string>} The names of the services which the function requires.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $provide
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has a number of methods for registering components
 * with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Many of these functions are also exposed on
 * {@link angular.Module}.
 *
 * An Angular **service** is a singleton object created by a **service factory**.  These **service
 * factories** are functions which, in turn, are created by a **service provider**.
 * The **service providers** are constructor functions. When instantiated they must contain a
 * property called `$get`, which holds the **service factory** function.
 *
 * When you request a service, the {@link auto.$injector $injector} is responsible for finding the
 * correct **service provider**, instantiating it and then calling its `$get` **service factory**
 * function to get the instance of the **service**.
 *
 * Often services have no configuration options and there is no need to add methods to the service
 * provider.  The provider will be no more than a constructor function with a `$get` property. For
 * these cases the {@link auto.$provide $provide} service has additional helper methods to register
 * services without specifying a provider.
 *
 * * {@link auto.$provide#provider provider(name, provider)} - registers a **service provider** with the
 *     {@link auto.$injector $injector}
 * * {@link auto.$provide#constant constant(name, obj)} - registers a value/object that can be accessed by
 *     providers and services.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#value value(name, obj)} - registers a value/object that can only be accessed by
 *     services, not providers.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#factory factory(name, fn)} - registers a service **factory function**
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will contain the
 *     given factory function.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#service service(name, Fn)} - registers a **constructor function**
 *     that will be wrapped in a **service provider** object, whose `$get` property will instantiate
 *      a new object using the given constructor function.
 * * {@link auto.$provide#decorator decorator(name, decorFn)} - registers a **decorator function** that
 *      will be able to modify or replace the implementation of another service.
 *
 * See the individual methods for more information and examples.
 */

/**
 * @ngdoc method
 * @name $provide#provider
 * @description
 *
 * Register a **provider function** with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. Provider functions
 * are constructor functions, whose instances are responsible for "providing" a factory for a
 * service.
 *
 * Service provider names start with the name of the service they provide followed by `Provider`.
 * For example, the {@link ng.$log $log} service has a provider called
 * {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider}.
 *
 * Service provider objects can have additional methods which allow configuration of the provider
 * and its service. Importantly, you can configure what kind of service is created by the `$get`
 * method, or how that service will act. For example, the {@link ng.$logProvider $logProvider} has a
 * method {@link ng.$logProvider#debugEnabled debugEnabled}
 * which lets you specify whether the {@link ng.$log $log} service will log debug messages to the
 * console or not.
 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the instance. NOTE: the provider will be available under `name +
                        'Provider'` key.
 * @param {(Object|function())} provider If the provider is:
 *
 *   - `Object`: then it should have a `$get` method. The `$get` method will be invoked using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#invoke $injector.invoke()} when an instance needs to be created.
 *   - `Constructor`: a new instance of the provider will be created using
 *     {@link auto.$injector#instantiate $injector.instantiate()}, then treated as `object`.
 *
 * @returns {Object} registered provider instance

 * @example
 *
 * The following example shows how to create a simple event tracking service and register it using
 * {@link auto.$provide#provider $provide.provider()}.
 *
 * ```js
 *  // Define the eventTracker provider
 *  function EventTrackerProvider() {
 *    var trackingUrl = '/track';
 *
 *    // A provider method for configuring where the tracked events should been saved
 *    this.setTrackingUrl = function(url) {
 *      trackingUrl = url;
 *    };
 *
 *    // The service factory function
 *    this.$get = ['$http', function($http) {
 *      var trackedEvents = {};
 *      return {
 *        // Call this to track an event
 *        event: function(event) {
 *          var count = trackedEvents[event] || 0;
 *          count += 1;

 *        save: function() {
 *          $http.post(trackingUrl, trackedEvents);
 *        }
 *      };
 *    }];
 *  }

 *    var postSpy;
 *
 *    beforeEach(module(function($provide) {

 *
 *    beforeEach(module(function(eventTrackerProvider) {
 *      // Configure eventTracker provider
 *      eventTrackerProvider.setTrackingUrl('/custom-track');
 *    }));

 *      expect(eventTracker.event('login')).toEqual(2);
 *    }));
 *

 *
 * Register a **decorator function** with the {@link auto.$injector $injector}. A decorator function

 * that replaces (or wraps and delegates to) the original service.
 *
 * You can find out more about using decorators in the {@link guide/decorators} guide.
 *
 * @param {string} name The name of the service to decorate.

 *    Local injection arguments:
 *
 *    * `$delegate` - The original service instance, which can be replaced, monkey patched, configured,

   * @description
   * When called, it scrolls to the element related to the specified `hash` or (if omitted) to the
   * current value of {@link ng.$location#hash $location.hash()}, according to the rules specified
   * in the
   * [HTML5 spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/browsers.html#an-indicated-part-of-the-document).
   *
   * It also watches the {@link ng.$location#hash $location.hash()} and automatically scrolls to
   * match any anchor whenever it changes. This can be disabled by calling
   * {@link ng.$anchorScrollProvider#disableAutoScrolling $anchorScrollProvider.disableAutoScrolling()}.
   *
   * Additionally, you can use its {@link ng.$anchorScroll#yOffset yOffset} property to specify a
   * vertical scroll-offset (either fixed or dynamic).
   *
   * @param {string=} hash The hash specifying the element to scroll to. If omitted, the value of
   *                       {@link ng.$location#hash $location.hash()} will be used.
   *
   * @property {(number|function|jqLite)} yOffset
   * If set, specifies a vertical scroll-offset. This is often useful when there are fixed
   * positioned elements at the top of the page, such as navbars, headers etc.
   *
   * `yOffset` can be specified in various ways:
   * - **number**: A fixed number of pixels to be used as offset.<br /><br />
   * - **function**: A getter function called everytime `$anchorScroll()` is executed. Must return
   *   a number representing the offset (in pixels).<br /><br />
   * - **jqLite**: A jqLite/jQuery element to be used for specifying the offset. The distance from
   *   the top of the page to the element's bottom will be used as offset.<br />
   *   **Note**: The element will be taken into account only as long as its `position` is set to
   *   `fixed`. This option is useful, when dealing with responsive navbars/headers that adjust
   *   their height and/or positioning according to the viewport's size.
   *
   * <br />
   * <div class="alert alert-warning">
   * In order for `yOffset` to work properly, scrolling should take place on the document's root and
   * not some child element.

     * @ngdoc service
     * @name $animate
     * @description The $animate service exposes a series of DOM utility methods that provide support
     * for animation hooks. The default behavior is the application of DOM operations, however,
     * when an animation is detected (and animations are enabled), $animate will do the heavy lifting
     * to ensure that animation runs with the triggered DOM operation.
     *
     * By default $animate doesn't trigger any animations. This is because the `ngAnimate` module isn't
     * included and only when it is active then the animation hooks that `$animate` triggers will be
     * functional. Once active then all structural `ng-` directives will trigger animations as they perform
     * their DOM-related operations (enter, leave and move). Other directives such as `ngClass`,
     * `ngShow`, `ngHide` and `ngMessages` also provide support for animations.
     *
     * It is recommended that the`$animate` service is always used when executing DOM-related procedures within directives.
     *
     * To learn more about enabling animation support, click here to visit the
     * {@link ngAnimate ngAnimate module page}.

 *
 * @description
 * Compiles an HTML string or DOM into a template and produces a template function, which
 * can then be used to link {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope `scope`} and the template together.
 *
 * The compilation is a process of walking the DOM tree and matching DOM elements to

 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** This document is an in-depth reference of all directive options.
 * For a gentle introduction to directives with examples of common use cases,
 * see the {@link guide/directive directive guide}.
 * </div>
 *
 * ## Comprehensive Directive API
 *
 * There are many different options for a directive.
 *
 * The difference resides in the return value of the factory function.
 * You can either return a {@link $compile#directive-definition-object Directive Definition Object (see below)}
 * that defines the directive properties, or just the `postLink` function (all other properties will have
 * the default values).
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's recommended to use the "directive definition object" form.
 * </div>
 *
 * Here's an example directive declared with a Directive Definition Object:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       {@link $compile#-priority- priority}: 0,
 *       {@link $compile#-template- template}: '<div></div>', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       // or
 *       // {@link $compile#-templateurl- templateUrl}: 'directive.html', // or // function(tElement, tAttrs) { ... },
 *       {@link $compile#-transclude- transclude}: false,
 *       {@link $compile#-restrict- restrict}: 'A',
 *       {@link $compile#-templatenamespace- templateNamespace}: 'html',
 *       {@link $compile#-scope- scope}: false,
 *       {@link $compile#-controller- controller}: function($scope, $element, $attrs, $transclude, otherInjectables) { ... },
 *       {@link $compile#-controlleras- controllerAs}: 'stringIdentifier',
 *       {@link $compile#-bindtocontroller- bindToController}: false,
 *       {@link $compile#-require- require}: 'siblingDirectiveName', // or // ['^parentDirectiveName', '?optionalDirectiveName', '?^optionalParent'],
 *       {@link $compile#-multielement- multiElement}: false,
 *       {@link $compile#-compile- compile}: function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) {
 *         return {
 *            {@link $compile#pre-linking-function pre}: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *            {@link $compile#post-linking-function post}: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *         }
 *         // or
 *         // return function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *       },
 *       // or
 *       // {@link $compile#-link- link}: {
 *       //  {@link $compile#pre-linking-function pre}: function preLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... },
 *       //  {@link $compile#post-linking-function post}: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller) { ... }
 *       // }
 *       // or
 *       // {@link $compile#-link- link}: function postLink( ... ) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Any unspecified options will use the default value. You can see the default values below.
 * </div>
 *
 * Therefore the above can be simplified as:
 *
 * ```js
 *   var myModule = angular.module(...);
 *
 *   myModule.directive('directiveName', function factory(injectables) {
 *     var directiveDefinitionObject = {
 *       link: function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *     };
 *     return directiveDefinitionObject;
 *     // or
 *     // return function postLink(scope, iElement, iAttrs) { ... }
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * ### Life-cycle hooks
 * Directive controllers can provide the following methods that are called by Angular at points in the life-cycle of the
 * directive:
 * * `$onInit()` - Called on each controller after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and
 *   had their bindings initialized (and before the pre &amp; post linking functions for the directives on
 *   this element). This is a good place to put initialization code for your controller.
 * * `$onChanges(changesObj)` - Called whenever one-way (`<`) or interpolation (`@`) bindings are updated. The
 *   `changesObj` is a hash whose keys are the names of the bound properties that have changed, and the values are an
 *   object of the form `{ currentValue, previousValue, isFirstChange() }`. Use this hook to trigger updates within a
 *   component such as cloning the bound value to prevent accidental mutation of the outer value.
 * * `$doCheck()` - Called on each turn of the digest cycle. Provides an opportunity to detect and act on
 *   changes. Any actions that you wish to take in response to the changes that you detect must be
 *   invoked from this hook; implementing this has no effect on when `$onChanges` is called. For example, this hook
 *   could be useful if you wish to perform a deep equality check, or to check a Date object, changes to which would not
 *   be detected by Angular's change detector and thus not trigger `$onChanges`. This hook is invoked with no arguments;
 *   if detecting changes, you must store the previous value(s) for comparison to the current values.
 * * `$onDestroy()` - Called on a controller when its containing scope is destroyed. Use this hook for releasing
 *   external resources, watches and event handlers. Note that components have their `$onDestroy()` hooks called in
 *   the same order as the `$scope.$broadcast` events are triggered, which is top down. This means that parent
 *   components will have their `$onDestroy()` hook called before child components.
 * * `$postLink()` - Called after this controller's element and its children have been linked. Similar to the post-link
 *   function this hook can be used to set up DOM event handlers and do direct DOM manipulation.
 *   Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled and linked since
 *   they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own compilation and linking has been
 *   suspended until that occurs.
 *
 * #### Comparison with Angular 2 life-cycle hooks
 * Angular 2 also uses life-cycle hooks for its components. While the Angular 1 life-cycle hooks are similar there are
 * some differences that you should be aware of, especially when it comes to moving your code from Angular 1 to Angular 2:
 *
 * * Angular 1 hooks are prefixed with `$`, such as `$onInit`. Angular 2 hooks are prefixed with `ng`, such as `ngOnInit`.
 * * Angular 1 hooks can be defined on the controller prototype or added to the controller inside its constructor.
 *   In Angular 2 you can only define hooks on the prototype of the Component class.
 * * Due to the differences in change-detection, you may get many more calls to `$doCheck` in Angular 1 than you would to
 *   `ngDoCheck` in Angular 2
 * * Changes to the model inside `$doCheck` will trigger new turns of the digest loop, which will cause the changes to be
 *   propagated throughout the application.
 *   Angular 2 does not allow the `ngDoCheck` hook to trigger a change outside of the component. It will either throw an
 *   error or do nothing depending upon the state of `enableProdMode()`.
 *
 * #### Life-cycle hook examples
 *
 * This example shows how you can check for mutations to a Date object even though the identity of the object
 * has not changed.
 *
 * <example name="doCheckDateExample" module="do-check-module">
 *   <file name="app.js">
 *     angular.module('do-check-module', [])
 *       .component('app', {
 *         template:
 *           'Month: <input ng-model="$ctrl.month" ng-change="$ctrl.updateDate()">' +
 *           'Date: {{ $ctrl.date }}' +
 *           '<test date="$ctrl.date"></test>',
 *         controller: function() {
 *           this.date = new Date();
 *           this.month = this.date.getMonth();
 *           this.updateDate = function() {
 *             this.date.setMonth(this.month);
 *           };
 *         }
 *       })
 *       .component('test', {
 *         bindings: { date: '<' },
 *         template:
 *           '<pre>{{ $ctrl.log | json }}</pre>',
 *         controller: function() {
 *           var previousValue;
 *           this.log = [];
 *           this.$doCheck = function() {
 *             var currentValue = this.date && this.date.valueOf();
 *             if (previousValue !== currentValue) {
 *               this.log.push('doCheck: date mutated: ' + this.date);
 *               previousValue = currentValue;
 *             }
 *           };
 *         }
 *       });
 *   </file>
 *   <file name="index.html">
 *     <app></app>
 *   </file>
 * </example>
 *
 * This example show how you might use `$doCheck` to trigger changes in your component's inputs even if the
 * actual identity of the component doesn't change. (Be aware that cloning and deep equality checks on large
 * arrays or objects can have a negative impact on your application performance)
 *
 * <example name="doCheckArrayExample" module="do-check-module">
 *   <file name="index.html">
 *     <div ng-init="items = []">
 *       <button ng-click="items.push(items.length)">Add Item</button>
 *       <button ng-click="items = []">Reset Items</button>
 *       <pre>{{ items }}</pre>
 *       <test items="items"></test>
 *     </div>
 *   </file>
 *   <file name="app.js">
 *      angular.module('do-check-module', [])
 *        .component('test', {
 *          bindings: { items: '<' },
 *          template:
 *            '<pre>{{ $ctrl.log | json }}</pre>',
 *          controller: function() {
 *            this.log = [];
 *
 *            this.$doCheck = function() {
 *              if (this.items_ref !== this.items) {
 *                this.log.push('doCheck: items changed');
 *                this.items_ref = this.items;
 *              }
 *              if (!angular.equals(this.items_clone, this.items)) {
 *                this.log.push('doCheck: items mutated');
 *                this.items_clone = angular.copy(this.items);
 *              }
 *            };
 *          }

 *
 * ### Directive Definition Object
 *
 * The directive definition object provides instructions to the {@link ng.$compile
 * compiler}. The attributes are:
 *
 * #### `multiElement`
 * When this property is set to true (default is `false`), the HTML compiler will collect DOM nodes between
 * nodes with the attributes `directive-name-start` and `directive-name-end`, and group them
 * together as the directive elements. It is recommended that this feature be used on directives
 * which are not strictly behavioral (such as {@link ngClick}), and which
 * do not manipulate or replace child nodes (such as {@link ngInclude}).
 *
 * #### `priority`
 * When there are multiple directives defined on a single DOM element, sometimes it
 * is necessary to specify the order in which the directives are applied. The `priority` is used
 * to sort the directives before their `compile` functions get called. Priority is defined as a
 * number. Directives with greater numerical `priority` are compiled first. Pre-link functions
 * are also run in priority order, but post-link functions are run in reverse order. The order
 * of directives with the same priority is undefined. The default priority is `0`.
 *
 * #### `terminal`
 * If set to true then the current `priority` will be the last set of directives
 * which will execute (any directives at the current priority will still execute
 * as the order of execution on same `priority` is undefined). Note that expressions
 * and other directives used in the directive's template will also be excluded from execution.
 *
 * #### `scope`
 * The scope property can be `false`, `true`, or an object:
 *
 * * **`false` (default):** No scope will be created for the directive. The directive will use its
 * parent's scope.
 *
 * * **`true`:** A new child scope that prototypically inherits from its parent will be created for
 * the directive's element. If multiple directives on the same element request a new scope,
 * only one new scope is created.
 *
 * * **`{...}` (an object hash):** A new "isolate" scope is created for the directive's element. The
 * 'isolate' scope differs from normal scope in that it does not prototypically inherit from its parent
 * scope. This is useful when creating reusable components, which should not accidentally read or modify
 * data in the parent scope.
 *
 * The 'isolate' scope object hash defines a set of local scope properties derived from attributes on the
 * directive's element. These local properties are useful for aliasing values for templates. The keys in
 * the object hash map to the name of the property on the isolate scope; the values define how the property
 * is bound to the parent scope, via matching attributes on the directive's element:
 *
 * * `@` or `@attr` - bind a local scope property to the value of DOM attribute. The result is
 *   always a string since DOM attributes are strings. If no `attr` name is specified then the
 *   attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name. Given `<my-component
 *   my-attr="hello {{name}}">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: { localName:'@myAttr' }`,
 *   the directive's scope property `localName` will reflect the interpolated value of `hello
 *   {{name}}`. As the `name` attribute changes so will the `localName` property on the directive's
 *   scope. The `name` is read from the parent scope (not the directive's scope).
 *
 * * `=` or `=attr` - set up a bidirectional binding between a local scope property and an expression
 *   passed via the attribute `attr`. The expression is evaluated in the context of the parent scope.
 *   If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local
 *   name. Given `<my-component my-attr="parentModel">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: {
 *   localModel: '=myAttr' }`, the property `localModel` on the directive's scope will reflect the
 *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Changes to `parentModel` will be reflected in
 *   `localModel` and vice versa. Optional attributes should be marked as such with a question mark:
 *   `=?` or `=?attr`. If the binding expression is non-assignable, or if the attribute isn't
 *   optional and doesn't exist, an exception ({@link error/$compile/nonassign `$compile:nonassign`})
 *   will be thrown upon discovering changes to the local value, since it will be impossible to sync
 *   them back to the parent scope. By default, the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`}
 *   method is used for tracking changes, and the equality check is based on object identity.
 *   However, if an object literal or an array literal is passed as the binding expression, the
 *   equality check is done by value (using the {@link angular.equals} function). It's also possible
 *   to watch the evaluated value shallowly with {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection
 *   `$watchCollection`}: use `=*` or `=*attr` (`=*?` or `=*?attr` if the attribute is optional).
 *
  * * `<` or `<attr` - set up a one-way (one-directional) binding between a local scope property and an
 *   expression passed via the attribute `attr`. The expression is evaluated in the context of the
 *   parent scope. If no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the
 *   local name. You can also make the binding optional by adding `?`: `<?` or `<?attr`.
 *
 *   For example, given `<my-component my-attr="parentModel">` and directive definition of
 *   `scope: { localModel:'<myAttr' }`, then the isolated scope property `localModel` will reflect the
 *   value of `parentModel` on the parent scope. Any changes to `parentModel` will be reflected
 *   in `localModel`, but changes in `localModel` will not reflect in `parentModel`. There are however
 *   two caveats:
 *     1. one-way binding does not copy the value from the parent to the isolate scope, it simply
 *     sets the same value. That means if your bound value is an object, changes to its properties
 *     in the isolated scope will be reflected in the parent scope (because both reference the same object).
 *     2. one-way binding watches changes to the **identity** of the parent value. That means the
 *     {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch `$watch`} on the parent value only fires if the reference
 *     to the value has changed. In most cases, this should not be of concern, but can be important
 *     to know if you one-way bind to an object, and then replace that object in the isolated scope.
 *     If you now change a property of the object in your parent scope, the change will not be
 *     propagated to the isolated scope, because the identity of the object on the parent scope
 *     has not changed. Instead you must assign a new object.
 *
 *   One-way binding is useful if you do not plan to propagate changes to your isolated scope bindings
 *   back to the parent. However, it does not make this completely impossible.
 *
 * * `&` or `&attr` - provides a way to execute an expression in the context of the parent scope. If
 *   no `attr` name is specified then the attribute name is assumed to be the same as the local name.
 *   Given `<my-component my-attr="count = count + value">` and the isolate scope definition `scope: {
 *   localFn:'&myAttr' }`, the isolate scope property `localFn` will point to a function wrapper for
 *   the `count = count + value` expression. Often it's desirable to pass data from the isolated scope
 *   via an expression to the parent scope. This can be done by passing a map of local variable names
 *   and values into the expression wrapper fn. For example, if the expression is `increment(amount)`
 *   then we can specify the amount value by calling the `localFn` as `localFn({amount: 22})`.
 *
 * In general it's possible to apply more than one directive to one element, but there might be limitations
 * depending on the type of scope required by the directives. The following points will help explain these limitations.
 * For simplicity only two directives are taken into account, but it is also applicable for several directives:
 *
 * * **no scope** + **no scope** => Two directives which don't require their own scope will use their parent's scope
 * * **child scope** + **no scope** =>  Both directives will share one single child scope
 * * **child scope** + **child scope** =>  Both directives will share one single child scope
 * * **isolated scope** + **no scope** =>  The isolated directive will use it's own created isolated scope. The other directive will use
 * its parent's scope
 * * **isolated scope** + **child scope** =>  **Won't work!** Only one scope can be related to one element. Therefore these directives cannot
 * be applied to the same element.
 * * **isolated scope** + **isolated scope**  =>  **Won't work!** Only one scope can be related to one element. Therefore these directives
 * cannot be applied to the same element.
 *
 *
 * #### `bindToController`
 * This property is used to bind scope properties directly to the controller. It can be either
 * `true` or an object hash with the same format as the `scope` property.
 *
 * When an isolate scope is used for a directive (see above), `bindToController: true` will
 * allow a component to have its properties bound to the controller, rather than to scope.
 *
 * After the controller is instantiated, the initial values of the isolate scope bindings will be bound to the controller
 * properties. You can access these bindings once they have been initialized by providing a controller method called
 * `$onInit`, which is called after all the controllers on an element have been constructed and had their bindings
 * initialized.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Deprecation warning:** although bindings for non-ES6 class controllers are currently
 * bound to `this` before the controller constructor is called, this use is now deprecated. Please place initialization
 * code that relies upon bindings inside a `$onInit` method on the controller, instead.
 * </div>
 *
 * It is also possible to set `bindToController` to an object hash with the same format as the `scope` property.
 * This will set up the scope bindings to the controller directly. Note that `scope` can still be used
 * to define which kind of scope is created. By default, no scope is created. Use `scope: {}` to create an isolate
 * scope (useful for component directives).
 *
 * If both `bindToController` and `scope` are defined and have object hashes, `bindToController` overrides `scope`.
 *
 *
 * #### `controller`
 * Controller constructor function. The controller is instantiated before the
 * pre-linking phase and can be accessed by other directives (see
 * `require` attribute). This allows the directives to communicate with each other and augment
 * each other's behavior. The controller is injectable (and supports bracket notation) with the following locals:
 *
 * * `$scope` - Current scope associated with the element
 * * `$element` - Current element
 * * `$attrs` - Current attributes object for the element
 * * `$transclude` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope:
 *   `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement, slotName)`:
 *    * `scope`: (optional) override the scope.
 *    * `cloneLinkingFn`: (optional) argument to create clones of the original transcluded content.
 *    * `futureParentElement` (optional):
 *        * defines the parent to which the `cloneLinkingFn` will add the cloned elements.
 *        * default: `$element.parent()` resp. `$element` for `transclude:'element'` resp. `transclude:true`.
 *        * only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html elements (e.g. SVG elements)
 *          and when the `cloneLinkingFn` is passed,
 *          as those elements need to created and cloned in a special way when they are defined outside their
 *          usual containers (e.g. like `<svg>`).
 *        * See also the `directive.templateNamespace` property.
 *    * `slotName`: (optional) the name of the slot to transclude. If falsy (e.g. `null`, `undefined` or `''`)
 *      then the default transclusion is provided.
 *    The `$transclude` function also has a method on it, `$transclude.isSlotFilled(slotName)`, which returns
 *    `true` if the specified slot contains content (i.e. one or more DOM nodes).
 *
 * #### `require`
 * Require another directive and inject its controller as the fourth argument to the linking function. The
 * `require` property can be a string, an array or an object:
 * * a **string** containing the name of the directive to pass to the linking function
 * * an **array** containing the names of directives to pass to the linking function. The argument passed to the
 * linking function will be an array of controllers in the same order as the names in the `require` property
 * * an **object** whose property values are the names of the directives to pass to the linking function. The argument
 * passed to the linking function will also be an object with matching keys, whose values will hold the corresponding
 * controllers.
 *
 * If the `require` property is an object and `bindToController` is truthy, then the required controllers are
 * bound to the controller using the keys of the `require` property. This binding occurs after all the controllers
 * have been constructed but before `$onInit` is called.
 * If the name of the required controller is the same as the local name (the key), the name can be
 * omitted. For example, `{parentDir: '^^'}` is equivalent to `{parentDir: '^^parentDir'}`.
 * See the {@link $compileProvider#component} helper for an example of how this can be used.
 * If no such required directive(s) can be found, or if the directive does not have a controller, then an error is
 * raised (unless no link function is specified and the required controllers are not being bound to the directive
 * controller, in which case error checking is skipped). The name can be prefixed with:
 *
 * * (no prefix) - Locate the required controller on the current element. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?` - Attempt to locate the required controller or pass `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `^^` - Locate the required controller by searching the element's parents. Throw an error if not found.
 * * `?^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element and its parents or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 * * `?^^` - Attempt to locate the required controller by searching the element's parents, or pass
 *   `null` to the `link` fn if not found.
 *
 *
 * #### `controllerAs`
 * Identifier name for a reference to the controller in the directive's scope.
 * This allows the controller to be referenced from the directive template. This is especially
 * useful when a directive is used as component, i.e. with an `isolate` scope. It's also possible
 * to use it in a directive without an `isolate` / `new` scope, but you need to be aware that the
 * `controllerAs` reference might overwrite a property that already exists on the parent scope.
 *
 *
 * #### `restrict`
 * String of subset of `EACM` which restricts the directive to a specific directive
 * declaration style. If omitted, the defaults (elements and attributes) are used.
 *
 * * `E` - Element name (default): `<my-directive></my-directive>`
 * * `A` - Attribute (default): `<div my-directive="exp"></div>`
 * * `C` - Class: `<div class="my-directive: exp;"></div>`
 * * `M` - Comment: `<!-- directive: my-directive exp -->`
 *
 *
 * #### `templateNamespace`
 * String representing the document type used by the markup in the template.
 * AngularJS needs this information as those elements need to be created and cloned
 * in a special way when they are defined outside their usual containers like `<svg>` and `<math>`.
 *
 * * `html` - All root nodes in the template are HTML. Root nodes may also be
 *   top-level elements such as `<svg>` or `<math>`.
 * * `svg` - The root nodes in the template are SVG elements (excluding `<math>`).
 * * `math` - The root nodes in the template are MathML elements (excluding `<svg>`).
 *
 * If no `templateNamespace` is specified, then the namespace is considered to be `html`.
 *
 * #### `template`
 * HTML markup that may:
 * * Replace the contents of the directive's element (default).
 * * Replace the directive's element itself (if `replace` is true - DEPRECATED).
 * * Wrap the contents of the directive's element (if `transclude` is true).
 *
 * Value may be:
 *
 * * A string. For example `<div red-on-hover>{{delete_str}}</div>`.
 * * A function which takes two arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile`
 *   function api below) and returns a string value.
 *
 *
 * #### `templateUrl`
 * This is similar to `template` but the template is loaded from the specified URL, asynchronously.
 *
 * Because template loading is asynchronous the compiler will suspend compilation of directives on that element
 * for later when the template has been resolved.  In the meantime it will continue to compile and link
 * sibling and parent elements as though this element had not contained any directives.
 *
 * The compiler does not suspend the entire compilation to wait for templates to be loaded because this
 * would result in the whole app "stalling" until all templates are loaded asynchronously - even in the
 * case when only one deeply nested directive has `templateUrl`.
 *
 * Template loading is asynchronous even if the template has been preloaded into the {@link $templateCache}
 *
 * You can specify `templateUrl` as a string representing the URL or as a function which takes two
 * arguments `tElement` and `tAttrs` (described in the `compile` function api below) and returns
 * a string value representing the url.  In either case, the template URL is passed through {@link
 * $sce#getTrustedResourceUrl $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl}.
 *
 *
 * #### `replace` ([*DEPRECATED*!], will be removed in next major release - i.e. v2.0)
 * specify what the template should replace. Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * * `true` - the template will replace the directive's element.
 * * `false` - the template will replace the contents of the directive's element.
 *
 * The replacement process migrates all of the attributes / classes from the old element to the new
 * one. See the {@link guide/directive#template-expanding-directive
 * Directives Guide} for an example.
 *
 * There are very few scenarios where element replacement is required for the application function,
 * the main one being reusable custom components that are used within SVG contexts
 * (because SVG doesn't work with custom elements in the DOM tree).
 *
 * #### `transclude`
 * Extract the contents of the element where the directive appears and make it available to the directive.
 * The contents are compiled and provided to the directive as a **transclusion function**. See the
 * {@link $compile#transclusion Transclusion} section below.
 *
 *
 * #### `compile`
 *
 * ```js
 *   function compile(tElement, tAttrs, transclude) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The compile function deals with transforming the template DOM. Since most directives do not do
 * template transformation, it is not used often. The compile function takes the following arguments:
 *
 *   * `tElement` - template element - The element where the directive has been declared. It is
 *     safe to do template transformation on the element and child elements only.
 *
 *   * `tAttrs` - template attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive compile functions.
 *
 *   * `transclude` -  [*DEPRECATED*!] A transclude linking function: `function(scope, cloneLinkingFn)`
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The template instance and the link instance may be different objects if the template has
 * been cloned. For this reason it is **not** safe to do anything other than DOM transformations that
 * apply to all cloned DOM nodes within the compile function. Specifically, DOM listener registration
 * should be done in a linking function rather than in a compile function.
 * </div>

 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** The compile function cannot handle directives that recursively use themselves in their
 * own templates or compile functions. Compiling these directives results in an infinite loop and
 * stack overflow errors.
 *
 * This can be avoided by manually using $compile in the postLink function to imperatively compile
 * a directive's template instead of relying on automatic template compilation via `template` or
 * `templateUrl` declaration or manual compilation inside the compile function.
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-danger">
 * **Note:** The `transclude` function that is passed to the compile function is deprecated, as it
 *   e.g. does not know about the right outer scope. Please use the transclude function that is passed
 *   to the link function instead.
 * </div>

 * A compile function can have a return value which can be either a function or an object.
 *
 * * returning a (post-link) function - is equivalent to registering the linking function via the
 *   `link` property of the config object when the compile function is empty.
 *
 * * returning an object with function(s) registered via `pre` and `post` properties - allows you to
 *   control when a linking function should be called during the linking phase. See info about
 *   pre-linking and post-linking functions below.
 *
 *
 * #### `link`
 * This property is used only if the `compile` property is not defined.
 *
 * ```js
 *   function link(scope, iElement, iAttrs, controller, transcludeFn) { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * The link function is responsible for registering DOM listeners as well as updating the DOM. It is
 * executed after the template has been cloned. This is where most of the directive logic will be
 * put.
 *
 *   * `scope` - {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} - The scope to be used by the
 *     directive for registering {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watches}.
 *
 *   * `iElement` - instance element - The element where the directive is to be used. It is safe to
 *     manipulate the children of the element only in `postLink` function since the children have
 *     already been linked.
 *
 *   * `iAttrs` - instance attributes - Normalized list of attributes declared on this element shared
 *     between all directive linking functions.
 *
 *   * `controller` - the directive's required controller instance(s) - Instances are shared
 *     among all directives, which allows the directives to use the controllers as a communication
 *     channel. The exact value depends on the directive's `require` property:
 *       * no controller(s) required: the directive's own controller, or `undefined` if it doesn't have one
 *       * `string`: the controller instance
 *       * `array`: array of controller instances
 *
 *     If a required controller cannot be found, and it is optional, the instance is `null`,
 *     otherwise the {@link error:$compile:ctreq Missing Required Controller} error is thrown.
 *
 *     Note that you can also require the directive's own controller - it will be made available like
 *     any other controller.
 *
 *   * `transcludeFn` - A transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.
 *     This is the same as the `$transclude` parameter of directive controllers,
 *     see {@link ng.$compile#-controller- the controller section for details}.
 *     `function([scope], cloneLinkingFn, futureParentElement)`.
 *
 * #### Pre-linking function
 *
 * Executed before the child elements are linked. Not safe to do DOM transformation since the
 * compiler linking function will fail to locate the correct elements for linking.
 *
 * #### Post-linking function
 *
 * Executed after the child elements are linked.
 *
 * Note that child elements that contain `templateUrl` directives will not have been compiled
 * and linked since they are waiting for their template to load asynchronously and their own
 * compilation and linking has been suspended until that occurs.
 *
 * It is safe to do DOM transformation in the post-linking function on elements that are not waiting
 * for their async templates to be resolved.
 *
 *
 * ### Transclusion
 *
 * Transclusion is the process of extracting a collection of DOM elements from one part of the DOM and
 * copying them to another part of the DOM, while maintaining their connection to the original AngularJS
 * scope from where they were taken.
 *
 * Transclusion is used (often with {@link ngTransclude}) to insert the
 * original contents of a directive's element into a specified place in the template of the directive.
 * The benefit of transclusion, over simply moving the DOM elements manually, is that the transcluded
 * content has access to the properties on the scope from which it was taken, even if the directive
 * has isolated scope.
 * See the {@link guide/directive#creating-a-directive-that-wraps-other-elements Directives Guide}.
 *
 * This makes it possible for the widget to have private state for its template, while the transcluded
 * content has access to its originating scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** When testing an element transclude directive you must not place the directive at the root of the
 * DOM fragment that is being compiled. See {@link guide/unit-testing#testing-transclusion-directives
 * Testing Transclusion Directives}.
 * </div>
 *
 * There are three kinds of transclusion depending upon whether you want to transclude just the contents of the
 * directive's element, the entire element or multiple parts of the element contents:
 *
 * * `true` - transclude the content (i.e. the child nodes) of the directive's element.
 * * `'element'` - transclude the whole of the directive's element including any directives on this
 *   element that defined at a lower priority than this directive. When used, the `template`
 *   property is ignored.
 * * **`{...}` (an object hash):** - map elements of the content onto transclusion "slots" in the template.
 *
 * **Mult-slot transclusion** is declared by providing an object for the `transclude` property.
 *
 * This object is a map where the keys are the name of the slot to fill and the value is an element selector
 * used to match the HTML to the slot. The element selector should be in normalized form (e.g. `myElement`)
 * and will match the standard element variants (e.g. `my-element`, `my:element`, `data-my-element`, etc).
 *
 * For further information check out the guide on {@link guide/directive#matching-directives Matching Directives}
 *
 * If the element selector is prefixed with a `?` then that slot is optional.
 *
 * For example, the transclude object `{ slotA: '?myCustomElement' }` maps `<my-custom-element>` elements to
 * the `slotA` slot, which can be accessed via the `$transclude` function or via the {@link ngTransclude} directive.
 *
 * Slots that are not marked as optional (`?`) will trigger a compile time error if there are no matching elements
 * in the transclude content. If you wish to know if an optional slot was filled with content, then you can call
 * `$transclude.isSlotFilled(slotName)` on the transclude function passed to the directive's link function and
 * injectable into the directive's controller.
 *
 *
 * #### Transclusion Functions
 *
 * When a directive requests transclusion, the compiler extracts its contents and provides a **transclusion
 * function** to the directive's `link` function and `controller`. This transclusion function is a special
 * **linking function** that will return the compiled contents linked to a new transclusion scope.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * If you are just using {@link ngTransclude} then you don't need to worry about this function, since
 * ngTransclude will deal with it for us.
 * </div>
 *
 * If you want to manually control the insertion and removal of the transcluded content in your directive
 * then you must use this transclude function. When you call a transclude function it returns a a jqLite/JQuery
 * object that contains the compiled DOM, which is linked to the correct transclusion scope.
 *
 * When you call a transclusion function you can pass in a **clone attach function**. This function accepts
 * two parameters, `function(clone, scope) { ... }`, where the `clone` is a fresh compiled copy of your transcluded
 * content and the `scope` is the newly created transclusion scope, which the clone will be linked to.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: Always provide a `cloneFn` (clone attach function) when you call a transclude function
 * since you then get a fresh clone of the original DOM and also have access to the new transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * It is normal practice to attach your transcluded content (`clone`) to the DOM inside your **clone
 * attach function**:
 *
 * ```js
 * var transcludedContent, transclusionScope;
 *
 * $transclude(function(clone, scope) {
 *   element.append(clone);
 *   transcludedContent = clone;
 *   transclusionScope = scope;
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Later, if you want to remove the transcluded content from your DOM then you should also destroy the
 * associated transclusion scope:
 *
 * ```js
 * transcludedContent.remove();
 * transclusionScope.$destroy();
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Best Practice**: if you intend to add and remove transcluded content manually in your directive
 * (by calling the transclude function to get the DOM and calling `element.remove()` to remove it),
 * then you are also responsible for calling `$destroy` on the transclusion scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * The built-in DOM manipulation directives, such as {@link ngIf}, {@link ngSwitch} and {@link ngRepeat}
 * automatically destroy their transcluded clones as necessary so you do not need to worry about this if
 * you are simply using {@link ngTransclude} to inject the transclusion into your directive.
 *
 *
 * #### Transclusion Scopes
 *
 * When you call a transclude function it returns a DOM fragment that is pre-bound to a **transclusion
 * scope**. This scope is special, in that it is a child of the directive's scope (and so gets destroyed
 * when the directive's scope gets destroyed) but it inherits the properties of the scope from which it
 * was taken.
 *
 * For example consider a directive that uses transclusion and isolated scope. The DOM hierarchy might look
 * like this:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-app>
 *   <div isolate>
 *     <div transclusion>
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The `$parent` scope hierarchy will look like this:
 *
   ```
   - $rootScope
     - isolate
       - transclusion
   ```
 *
 * but the scopes will inherit prototypically from different scopes to their `$parent`.
 *
   ```
   - $rootScope
     - transclusion
   - isolate
   ```
 *
 *
 * ### Attributes
 *
 * The {@link ng.$compile.directive.Attributes Attributes} object - passed as a parameter in the
 * `link()` or `compile()` functions. It has a variety of uses.
 *
 * * *Accessing normalized attribute names:* Directives like 'ngBind' can be expressed in many ways:
 *   'ng:bind', `data-ng-bind`, or 'x-ng-bind'. The attributes object allows for normalized access
 *   to the attributes.
 *
 * * *Directive inter-communication:* All directives share the same instance of the attributes
 *   object which allows the directives to use the attributes object as inter directive
 *   communication.
 *
 * * *Supports interpolation:* Interpolation attributes are assigned to the attribute object
 *   allowing other directives to read the interpolated value.
 *
 * * *Observing interpolated attributes:* Use `$observe` to observe the value changes of attributes
 *   that contain interpolation (e.g. `src="{{bar}}"`). Not only is this very efficient but it's also
 *   the only way to easily get the actual value because during the linking phase the interpolation

 * @param {number} maxPriority only apply directives lower than given priority (Only effects the
 *                 root element(s), not their children)
 * @returns {function(scope, cloneAttachFn=, options=)} a link function which is used to bind template
 * (a DOM element/tree) to a scope. Where:
 *
 *  * `scope` - A {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope Scope} to bind to.
 *  * `cloneAttachFn` - If `cloneAttachFn` is provided, then the link function will clone the
 *  `template` and call the `cloneAttachFn` function allowing the caller to attach the
 *  cloned elements to the DOM document at the appropriate place. The `cloneAttachFn` is
 *  called as: <br/> `cloneAttachFn(clonedElement, scope)` where:
 *
 *      * `clonedElement` - is a clone of the original `element` passed into the compiler.
 *      * `scope` - is the current scope with which the linking function is working with.
 *
 *  * `options` - An optional object hash with linking options. If `options` is provided, then the following
 *  keys may be used to control linking behavior:
 *
 *      * `parentBoundTranscludeFn` - the transclude function made available to
 *        directives; if given, it will be passed through to the link functions of
 *        directives found in `element` during compilation.
 *      * `transcludeControllers` - an object hash with keys that map controller names
 *        to a hash with the key `instance`, which maps to the controller instance;
 *        if given, it will make the controllers available to directives on the compileNode:
 *        ```
 *        {
 *          parent: {
 *            instance: parentControllerInstance
 *          }
 *        }
 *        ```
 *      * `futureParentElement` - defines the parent to which the `cloneAttachFn` will add
 *        the cloned elements; only needed for transcludes that are allowed to contain non html
 *        elements (e.g. SVG elements). See also the directive.controller property.
 *
 * Calling the linking function returns the element of the template. It is either the original
 * element passed in, or the clone of the element if the `cloneAttachFn` is provided.
 *
 * After linking the view is not updated until after a call to $digest which typically is done by
 * Angular automatically.
 *
 * If you need access to the bound view, there are two ways to do it:
 *
 * - If you are not asking the linking function to clone the template, create the DOM element(s)
 *   before you send them to the compiler and keep this reference around.
 *   ```js
 *     var element = $compile('<p>{{total}}</p>')(scope);
 *   ```
 *
 * - if on the other hand, you need the element to be cloned, the view reference from the original
 *   example would not point to the clone, but rather to the original template that was cloned. In
 *   this case, you can access the clone via the cloneAttachFn:
 *   ```js
 *     var templateElement = angular.element('<p>{{total}}</p>'),
 *         scope = ....;
 *
 *     var clonedElement = $compile(templateElement)(scope, function(clonedElement, scope) {
 *       //attach the clone to DOM document at the right place
 *     });
 *
 *     //now we have reference to the cloned DOM via `clonedElement`
 *   ```
 *
 *
 * For information on how the compiler works, see the
 * {@link guide/compiler Angular HTML Compiler} section of the Developer Guide.
 *
 * @knownIssue
 *
 * ### Double Compilation
 *
   Double compilation occurs when an already compiled part of the DOM gets
   compiled again. This is an undesired effect and can lead to misbehaving directives, performance issues,
   and memory leaks. Refer to the Compiler Guide {@link guide/compiler#double-compilation-and-how-to-avoid-it
   section on double compilation} for an in-depth explanation and ways to avoid it.

   * @description
   * Register a **component definition** with the compiler. This is a shorthand for registering a special
   * type of directive, which represents a self-contained UI component in your application. Such components
   * are always isolated (i.e. `scope: {}`) and are always restricted to elements (i.e. `restrict: 'E'`).
   *
   * Component definitions are very simple and do not require as much configuration as defining general
   * directives. Component definitions usually consist only of a template and a controller backing it.
   *
   * In order to make the definition easier, components enforce best practices like use of `controllerAs`,
   * `bindToController`. They always have **isolate scope** and are restricted to elements.
   *
   * Here are a few examples of how you would usually define components:
   *
   * ```js
   *   var myMod = angular.module(...);
   *   myMod.component('myComp', {
   *     template: '<div>My name is {{$ctrl.name}}</div>',
   *     controller: function() {
   *       this.name = 'shahar';
   *     }
   *   });
   *
   *   myMod.component('myComp', {
   *     template: '<div>My name is {{$ctrl.name}}</div>',
   *     bindings: {name: '@'}
   *   });
   *
   *   myMod.component('myComp', {
   *     templateUrl: 'views/my-comp.html',
   *     controller: 'MyCtrl',
   *     controllerAs: 'ctrl',
   *     bindings: {name: '@'}
   *   });
   *
   * ```

 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $exceptionHandler
 * @requires ng.$log
 * @this
 *
 * @description
 * Any uncaught exception in angular expressions is delegated to this service.
 * The default implementation simply delegates to `$log.error` which logs it into
 * the browser console.
 *
 * In unit tests, if `angular-mocks.js` is loaded, this service is overridden by
 * {@link ngMock.$exceptionHandler mock $exceptionHandler} which aids in testing.
 *
 * ## Example:
 *
 * The example below will overwrite the default `$exceptionHandler` in order to (a) log uncaught
 * errors to the backend for later inspection by the developers and (b) to use `$log.warn()` instead
 * of `$log.error()`.
 *
 * ```js
 *   angular.
 *     module('exceptionOverwrite', []).
 *     factory('$exceptionHandler', ['$log', 'logErrorsToBackend', function($log, logErrorsToBackend) {
 *       return function myExceptionHandler(exception, cause) {
 *         logErrorsToBackend(exception, cause);
 *         $log.warn(exception, cause);
 *       };
 *     }]);
 * ```
 *
 * <hr />
 * Note, that code executed in event-listeners (even those registered using jqLite's `on`/`bind`
 * methods) does not delegate exceptions to the {@link ng.$exceptionHandler $exceptionHandler}
 * (unless executed during a digest).
 *
 * If you wish, you can manually delegate exceptions, e.g.
 * `try { ... } catch(e) { $exceptionHandler(e); }`
 *
 * @param {Error} exception Exception associated with the error.
 * @param {string=} cause Optional information about the context in which

     * The `$http` service is a core Angular service that facilitates communication with the remote
     * HTTP servers via the browser's [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/xmlhttprequest)
     * object or via [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP).
     *
     * For unit testing applications that use `$http` service, see
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend $httpBackend mock}.
     *
     * For a higher level of abstraction, please check out the {@link ngResource.$resource
     * $resource} service.
     *
     * The $http API is based on the {@link ng.$q deferred/promise APIs} exposed by
     * the $q service. While for simple usage patterns this doesn't matter much, for advanced usage
     * it is important to familiarize yourself with these APIs and the guarantees they provide.
     *
     *
     * ## General usage
     * The `$http` service is a function which takes a single argument — a {@link $http#usage configuration object} —
     * that is used to generate an HTTP request and returns  a {@link ng.$q promise}.
     *
     * ```js
     *   // Simple GET request example:
     *   $http({
     *     method: 'GET',
     *     url: '/someUrl'
     *   }).then(function successCallback(response) {
     *       // this callback will be called asynchronously
     *       // when the response is available
     *     }, function errorCallback(response) {
     *       // called asynchronously if an error occurs
     *       // or server returns response with an error status.
     *     });
     * ```
     *
     * The response object has these properties:
     *
     *   - **data** – `{string|Object}` – The response body transformed with the transform
     *     functions.
     *   - **status** – `{number}` – HTTP status code of the response.
     *   - **headers** – `{function([headerName])}` – Header getter function.
     *   - **config** – `{Object}` – The configuration object that was used to generate the request.
     *   - **statusText** – `{string}` – HTTP status text of the response.
     *
     * A response status code between 200 and 299 is considered a success status and will result in
     * the success callback being called. Any response status code outside of that range is
     * considered an error status and will result in the error callback being called.
     * Also, status codes less than -1 are normalized to zero. -1 usually means the request was
     * aborted, e.g. using a `config.timeout`.
     * Note that if the response is a redirect, XMLHttpRequest will transparently follow it, meaning
     * that the outcome (success or error) will be determined by the final response status code.
     *
     *
     * ## Shortcut methods
     *
     * Shortcut methods are also available. All shortcut methods require passing in the URL, and
     * request data must be passed in for POST/PUT requests. An optional config can be passed as the
     * last argument.
     *
     * ```js
     *   $http.get('/someUrl', config).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
     *   $http.post('/someUrl', data, config).then(successCallback, errorCallback);
     * ```
     *
     * Complete list of shortcut methods:
     *
     * - {@link ng.$http#get $http.get}
     * - {@link ng.$http#head $http.head}
     * - {@link ng.$http#post $http.post}
     * - {@link ng.$http#put $http.put}
     * - {@link ng.$http#delete $http.delete}
     * - {@link ng.$http#jsonp $http.jsonp}
     * - {@link ng.$http#patch $http.patch}
     *
     *
     * ## Writing Unit Tests that use $http
     * When unit testing (using {@link ngMock ngMock}), it is necessary to call
     * {@link ngMock.$httpBackend#flush $httpBackend.flush()} to flush each pending
     * request using trained responses.
     *
     * ```
     * $httpBackend.expectGET(...);
     * $http.get(...);
     * $httpBackend.flush();
     * ```
     *
     * ## Deprecation Notice
     * <div class="alert alert-danger">
     *   The `$http` legacy promise methods `success` and `error` have been deprecated and will be
     *   removed in v1.6.0.
     *   Use the standard `then` method instead.
     *   If {@link $httpProvider#useLegacyPromiseExtensions `$httpProvider.useLegacyPromiseExtensions`} is set to
     *   `false` then these methods will throw {@link $http:legacy `$http/legacy`} error.
     * </div>
     *
     * ## Setting HTTP Headers
     *
     * The $http service will automatically add certain HTTP headers to all requests. These defaults
     * can be fully configured by accessing the `$httpProvider.defaults.headers` configuration
     * object, which currently contains this default configuration:
     *
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.common` (headers that are common for all requests):
     *   - <code>Accept: application/json, text/plain, \*&#65279;/&#65279;\*</code>
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.post`: (header defaults for POST requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     * - `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.put` (header defaults for PUT requests)
     *   - `Content-Type: application/json`
     *
     * To add or overwrite these defaults, simply add or remove a property from these configuration
     * objects. To add headers for an HTTP method other than POST or PUT, simply add a new object
     * with the lowercased HTTP method name as the key, e.g.
     * `$httpProvider.defaults.headers.get = { 'My-Header' : 'value' }`.
     *
     * The defaults can also be set at runtime via the `$http.defaults` object in the same
     * fashion. For example:
     *
     * ```
     * module.run(function($http) {
     *   $http.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = 'Basic YmVlcDpib29w';
     * });
     * ```
     *
     * In addition, you can supply a `headers` property in the config object passed when
     * calling `$http(config)`, which overrides the defaults without changing them globally.
     *
     * To explicitly remove a header automatically added via $httpProvider.defaults.headers on a per request basis,
     * Use the `headers` property, setting the desired header to `undefined`. For example:
     *
     * ```js
     * var req = {
     *  method: 'POST',
     *  url: 'http://example.com',
     *  headers: {
     *    'Content-Type': undefined
     *  },
     *  data: { test: 'test' }
     * }
     *
     * $http(req).then(function(){...}, function(){...});
     * ```
     *
     * ## Transforming Requests and Responses
     *
     * Both requests and responses can be transformed using transformation functions: `transformRequest`
     * and `transformResponse`. These properties can be a single function that returns
     * the transformed value (`function(data, headersGetter, status)`) or an array of such transformation functions,
     * which allows you to `push` or `unshift` a new transformation function into the transformation chain.
     *
     * <div class="alert alert-warning">
     * **Note:** Angular does not make a copy of the `data` parameter before it is passed into the `transformRequest` pipeline.
     * That means changes to the properties of `data` are not local to the transform function (since Javascript passes objects by reference).
     * For example, when calling `$http.get(url, $scope.myObject)`, modifications to the object's properties in a transformRequest
     * function will be reflected on the scope and in any templates where the object is data-bound.
     * To prevent this, transform functions should have no side-effects.
     * If you need to modify properties, it is recommended to make a copy of the data, or create new object to return.
     * </div>
     *
     * ### Default Transformations
     *
     * The `$httpProvider` provider and `$http` service expose `defaults.transformRequest` and
     * `defaults.transformResponse` properties. If a request does not provide its own transformations
     * then these will be applied.
     *
     * You can augment or replace the default transformations by modifying these properties by adding to or
     * replacing the array.
     *
     * Angular provides the following default transformations:
     *
     * Request transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformRequest` and `$http.defaults.transformRequest`):
     *
     * - If the `data` property of the request configuration object contains an object, serialize it
     *   into JSON format.
     *
     * Response transformations (`$httpProvider.defaults.transformResponse` and `$http.defaults.transformResponse`):
     *
     *  - If XSRF prefix is detected, strip it (see Security Considerations section below).
     *  - If JSON response is detected, deserialize it using a JSON parser.
     *
     *
     * ### Overriding the Default Transformations Per Request
     *
     * If you wish to override the request/response transformations only for a single request then provide
     * `transformRequest` and/or `transformResponse` properties on the configuration object passed
     * into `$http`.
     *
     * Note that if you provide these properties on the config object the default transformations will be
     * overwritten. If you wish to augment the default transformations then you must include them in your
     * local transformation array.
     *
     * The following code demonstrates adding a new response transformation to be run after the default response
     * transformations have been run.
     *
     * ```js
     * function appendTransform(defaults, transform) {
     *
     *   // We can't guarantee that the default transformation is an array
     *   defaults = angular.isArray(defaults) ? defaults : [defaults];
     *
     *   // Append the new transformation to the defaults
     *   return defaults.concat(transform);
     * }
     *
     * $http({
     *   url: '...',
     *   method: 'GET',
     *   transformResponse: appendTransform($http.defaults.transformResponse, function(value) {
     *     return doTransform(value);
     *   })
     * });
     * ```
     *
     *
     * ## Caching
     *
     * {@link ng.$http `$http`} responses are not cached by default. To enable caching, you must
     * set the config.cache value or the default cache value to TRUE or to a cache object (created
     * with {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`}). If defined, the value of config.cache takes
     * precedence over the default cache value.
     *
     * In order to:
     *   * cache all responses - set the default cache value to TRUE or to a cache object
     *   * cache a specific response - set config.cache value to TRUE or to a cache object
     *
     * If caching is enabled, but neither the default cache nor config.cache are set to a cache object,
     * then the default `$cacheFactory("$http")` object is used.
     *
     * The default cache value can be set by updating the
     * {@link ng.$http#defaults `$http.defaults.cache`} property or the
     * {@link $httpProvider#defaults `$httpProvider.defaults.cache`} property.
     *
     * When caching is enabled, {@link ng.$http `$http`} stores the response from the server using
     * the relevant cache object. The next time the same request is made, the response is returned
     * from the cache without sending a request to the server.
     *
     * Take note that:
     *
     *   * Only GET and JSONP requests are cached.
     *   * The cache key is the request URL including search parameters; headers are not considered.
     *   * Cached responses are returned asynchronously, in the same way as responses from the server.
     *   * If multiple identical requests are made using the same cache, which is not yet populated,
     *     one request will be made to the server and remaining requests will return the same response.
     *   * A cache-control header on the response does not affect if or how responses are cached.
     *
     *
     * ## Interceptors
     *
     * Before you start creating interceptors, be sure to understand the
     * {@link ng.$q $q and deferred/promise APIs}.
     *
     * For purposes of global error handling, authentication, or any kind of synchronous or
     * asynchronous pre-processing of request or postprocessing of responses, it is desirable to be
     * able to intercept requests before they are handed to the server and
     * responses before they are handed over to the application code that
     * initiated these requests. The interceptors leverage the {@link ng.$q
     * promise APIs} to fulfill this need for both synchronous and asynchronous pre-processing.
     *
     * The interceptors are service factories that are registered with the `$httpProvider` by
     * adding them to the `$httpProvider.interceptors` array. The factory is called and
     * injected with dependencies (if specified) and returns the interceptor.
     *
     * There are two kinds of interceptors (and two kinds of rejection interceptors):
     *
     *   * `request`: interceptors get called with a http {@link $http#usage config} object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `config` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `config`
     *     object directly, or a promise containing the `config` or a new `config` object.
     *   * `requestError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *   * `response`: interceptors get called with http `response` object. The function is free to
     *     modify the `response` object or create a new one. The function needs to return the `response`
     *     object directly, or as a promise containing the `response` or a new `response` object.
     *   * `responseError`: interceptor gets called when a previous interceptor threw an error or
     *     resolved with a rejection.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   // register the interceptor as a service
     *   $provide.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *       // optional method
     *       'request': function(config) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return config;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'requestError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       },
     *
     *
     *
     *       // optional method
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *         // do something on success
     *         return response;
     *       },
     *
     *       // optional method
     *      'responseError': function(rejection) {
     *         // do something on error
     *         if (canRecover(rejection)) {
     *           return responseOrNewPromise
     *         }
     *         return $q.reject(rejection);
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     *
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
     *
     *
     *   // alternatively, register the interceptor via an anonymous factory
     *   $httpProvider.interceptors.push(function($q, dependency1, dependency2) {
     *     return {
     *      'request': function(config) {
     *          // same as above
     *       },
     *
     *       'response': function(response) {
     *          // same as above
     *       }
     *     };
     *   });
     * ```
     *
     * ## Security Considerations
     *
     * When designing web applications, consider security threats from:
     *
     * - [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * - [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
     *
     * Both server and the client must cooperate in order to eliminate these threats. Angular comes
     * pre-configured with strategies that address these issues, but for this to work backend server
     * cooperation is required.
     *
     * ### JSON Vulnerability Protection
     *
     * A [JSON vulnerability](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/20/anatomy-of-a-subtle-json-vulnerability.aspx)
     * allows third party website to turn your JSON resource URL into
     * [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) request under some conditions. To
     * counter this your server can prefix all JSON requests with following string `")]}',\n"`.
     * Angular will automatically strip the prefix before processing it as JSON.
     *
     * For example if your server needs to return:
     * ```js
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * which is vulnerable to attack, your server can return:
     * ```js
     * )]}',
     * ['one','two']
     * ```
     *
     * Angular will strip the prefix, before processing the JSON.
     *
     *
     * ### Cross Site Request Forgery (XSRF) Protection
     *
     * [XSRF](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) is an attack technique by
     * which the attacker can trick an authenticated user into unknowingly executing actions on your
     * website. Angular provides a mechanism to counter XSRF. When performing XHR requests, the
     * $http service reads a token from a cookie (by default, `XSRF-TOKEN`) and sets it as an HTTP
     * header (`X-XSRF-TOKEN`). Since only JavaScript that runs on your domain could read the
     * cookie, your server can be assured that the XHR came from JavaScript running on your domain.
     * The header will not be set for cross-domain requests.
     *
     * To take advantage of this, your server needs to set a token in a JavaScript readable session
     * cookie called `XSRF-TOKEN` on the first HTTP GET request. On subsequent XHR requests the
     * server can verify that the cookie matches `X-XSRF-TOKEN` HTTP header, and therefore be sure
     * that only JavaScript running on your domain could have sent the request. The token must be
     * unique for each user and must be verifiable by the server (to prevent the JavaScript from
     * making up its own tokens). We recommend that the token is a digest of your site's
     * authentication cookie with a [salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography&#41;)
     * for added security.
     *
     * The name of the headers can be specified using the xsrfHeaderName and xsrfCookieName
     * properties of either $httpProvider.defaults at config-time, $http.defaults at run-time,
     * or the per-request config object.
     *
     * In order to prevent collisions in environments where multiple Angular apps share the
     * same domain or subdomain, we recommend that each application uses unique cookie name.
     *
     * @param {object} config Object describing the request to be made and how it should be
     *    processed. The object has following properties:
     *
     *    - **method** – `{string}` – HTTP method (e.g. 'GET', 'POST', etc)
     *    - **url** – `{string}` – Absolute or relative URL of the resource that is being requested.
     *    - **params** – `{Object.<string|Object>}` – Map of strings or objects which will be serialized
     *      with the `paramSerializer` and appended as GET parameters.
     *    - **data** – `{string|Object}` – Data to be sent as the request message data.
     *    - **headers** – `{Object}` – Map of strings or functions which return strings representing
     *      HTTP headers to send to the server. If the return value of a function is null, the
     *      header will not be sent. Functions accept a config object as an argument.
     *    - **eventHandlers** - `{Object}` - Event listeners to be bound to the XMLHttpRequest object.
     *      To bind events to the XMLHttpRequest upload object, use `uploadEventHandlers`.
     *      The handler will be called in the context of a `$apply` block.
     *    - **uploadEventHandlers** - `{Object}` - Event listeners to be bound to the XMLHttpRequest upload
     *      object. To bind events to the XMLHttpRequest object, use `eventHandlers`.
     *      The handler will be called in the context of a `$apply` block.
     *    - **xsrfHeaderName** – `{string}` – Name of HTTP header to populate with the XSRF token.
     *    - **xsrfCookieName** – `{string}` – Name of cookie containing the XSRF token.
     *    - **transformRequest** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      request body and headers and returns its transformed (typically serialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **transformResponse** –
     *      `{function(data, headersGetter, status)|Array.<function(data, headersGetter, status)>}` –
     *      transform function or an array of such functions. The transform function takes the http
     *      response body, headers and status and returns its transformed (typically deserialized) version.
     *      See {@link ng.$http#overriding-the-default-transformations-per-request
     *      Overriding the Default Transformations}
     *    - **paramSerializer** - `{string|function(Object<string,string>):string}` - A function used to
     *      prepare the string representation of request parameters (specified as an object).
     *      If specified as string, it is interpreted as function registered with the
     *      {@link $injector $injector}, which means you can create your own serializer
     *      by registering it as a {@link auto.$provide#service service}.
     *      The default serializer is the {@link $httpParamSerializer $httpParamSerializer};
     *      alternatively, you can use the {@link $httpParamSerializerJQLike $httpParamSerializerJQLike}
     *    - **cache** – `{boolean|Object}` – A boolean value or object created with
     *      {@link ng.$cacheFactory `$cacheFactory`} to enable or disable caching of the HTTP response.
     *      See {@link $http#caching $http Caching} for more information.
     *    - **timeout** – `{number|Promise}` – timeout in milliseconds, or {@link ng.$q promise}
     *      that should abort the request when resolved.
     *    - **withCredentials** - `{boolean}` - whether to set the `withCredentials` flag on the
     *      XHR object. See [requests with credentials](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#Requests_with_credentials)
     *      for more information.
     *    - **responseType** - `{string}` - see
     *      [XMLHttpRequest.responseType](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#xmlhttprequest-responsetype).
     *
     * @returns {HttpPromise} Returns a {@link ng.$q `Promise}` that will be resolved to a response object
     *                        when the request succeeds or fails.
     *
     *
     * @property {Array.<Object>} pendingRequests Array of config objects for currently pending
     *   requests. This is primarily meant to be used for debugging purposes.
     *

     *
     * @description
     *
     * Compiles a string with markup into an interpolation function. This service is used by the
     * HTML {@link ng.$compile $compile} service for data binding. See
     * {@link ng.$interpolateProvider $interpolateProvider} for configuring the
     * interpolation markup.
     *
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var exp = $interpolate('Hello {{name | uppercase}}!');
     *   expect(exp({name:'Angular'})).toEqual('Hello ANGULAR!');
     * ```
     *
     * `$interpolate` takes an optional fourth argument, `allOrNothing`. If `allOrNothing` is
     * `true`, the interpolation function will return `undefined` unless all embedded expressions
     * evaluate to a value other than `undefined`.
     *
     * ```js
     *   var $interpolate = ...; // injected
     *   var context = {greeting: 'Hello', name: undefined };
     *
     *   // default "forgiving" mode
     *   var exp = $interpolate('{{greeting}} {{name}}!');
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello !');
     *
     *   // "allOrNothing" mode

     *   expect(exp(context)).toBeUndefined();
     *   context.name = 'Angular';
     *   expect(exp(context)).toEqual('Hello Angular!');
     * ```
     *
     * `allOrNothing` is useful for interpolating URLs. `ngSrc` and `ngSrcset` use this behavior.
     *
     * #### Escaped Interpolation
     * $interpolate provides a mechanism for escaping interpolation markers. Start and end markers
     * can be escaped by preceding each of their characters with a REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash).
     * It will be rendered as a regular start/end marker, and will not be interpreted as an expression
     * or binding.
     *
     * This enables web-servers to prevent script injection attacks and defacing attacks, to some
     * degree, while also enabling code examples to work without relying on the
     * {@link ng.directive:ngNonBindable ngNonBindable} directive.
     *
     * **For security purposes, it is strongly encouraged that web servers escape user-supplied data,
     * replacing angle brackets (&lt;, &gt;) with &amp;lt; and &amp;gt; respectively, and replacing all
     * interpolation start/end markers with their escaped counterparts.**
     *
     * Escaped interpolation markers are only replaced with the actual interpolation markers in rendered
     * output when the $interpolate service processes the text. So, for HTML elements interpolated
     * by {@link ng.$compile $compile}, or otherwise interpolated with the `mustHaveExpression` parameter
     * set to `true`, the interpolated text must contain an unescaped interpolation expression. As such,
     * this is typically useful only when user-data is used in rendering a template from the server, or
     * when otherwise untrusted data is used by a directive.
     *
     * <example name="interpolation">
     *  <file name="index.html">
     *    <div ng-init="username='A user'">
     *      <p ng-init="apptitle='Escaping demo'">{{apptitle}}: \{\{ username = "defaced value"; \}\}
     *        </p>
     *      <p><strong>{{username}}</strong> attempts to inject code which will deface the
     *        application, but fails to accomplish their task, because the server has correctly
     *        escaped the interpolation start/end markers with REVERSE SOLIDUS U+005C (backslash)
     *        characters.</p>
     *      <p>Instead, the result of the attempted script injection is visible, and can be removed
     *        from the database by an administrator.</p>
     *    </div>
     *  </file>
     * </example>
     *
     * @knownIssue
     * It is currently not possible for an interpolated expression to contain the interpolation end
     * symbol. For example, `{{ '}}' }}` will be incorrectly interpreted as `{{ ' }}` + `' }}`, i.e.
     * an interpolated expression consisting of a single-quote (`'`) and the `' }}` string.
     *
     * @knownIssue
     * All directives and components must use the standard `{{` `}}` interpolation symbols
     * in their templates. If you change the application interpolation symbols the {@link $compile}
     * service will attempt to denormalize the standard symbols to the custom symbols.
     * The denormalization process is not clever enough to know not to replace instances of the standard
     * symbols where they would not normally be treated as interpolation symbols. For example in the following
     * code snippet the closing braces of the literal object will get incorrectly denormalized:
     *
     * ```
     * <div data-context='{"context":{"id":3,"type":"page"}}">
     * ```
     *
     * The workaround is to ensure that such instances are separated by whitespace:
     * ```
     * <div data-context='{"context":{"id":3,"type":"page"} }">
     * ```
     *
     * See https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14610#issuecomment-219401099 for more information.

// Sandboxing Angular Expressions
// ------------------------------
// Angular expressions are generally considered safe because these expressions only have direct
// access to `$scope` and locals. However, one can obtain the ability to execute arbitrary JS code by
// obtaining a reference to native JS functions such as the Function constructor.
//
// As an example, consider the following Angular expression:
//
//   {}.toString.constructor('alert("evil JS code")')
//
// This sandboxing technique is not perfect and doesn't aim to be. The goal is to prevent exploits
// against the expression language, but not to prevent exploits that were enabled by exposing
// sensitive JavaScript or browser APIs on Scope. Exposing such objects on a Scope is never a good
// practice and therefore we are not even trying to protect against interaction with an object
// explicitly exposed in this way.
//
// In general, it is not possible to access a Window object from an angular expression unless a
// window or some DOM object that has a reference to window is published onto a Scope.
// Similarly we prevent invocations of function known to be dangerous, as well as assignments to
// native objects.
//

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $q
 * @requires $rootScope
 * @this
 *
 * @description
 * A service that helps you run functions asynchronously, and use their return values (or exceptions)
 * when they are done processing.
 *
 * This is an implementation of promises/deferred objects inspired by
 * [Kris Kowal's Q](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).
 *
 * $q can be used in two fashions --- one which is more similar to Kris Kowal's Q or jQuery's Deferred
 * implementations, and the other which resembles ES6 (ES2015) promises to some degree.
 *
 * # $q constructor
 *
 * The streamlined ES6 style promise is essentially just using $q as a constructor which takes a `resolver`
 * function as the first argument. This is similar to the native Promise implementation from ES6,
 * see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).
 *
 * While the constructor-style use is supported, not all of the supporting methods from ES6 promises are
 * available yet.
 *
 * It can be used like so:
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     // perform some asynchronous operation, resolve or reject the promise when appropriate.
 *     return $q(function(resolve, reject) {
 *       setTimeout(function() {
 *         if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *           resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *         } else {
 *           reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *         }
 *       }, 1000);
 *     });
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * Note: progress/notify callbacks are not currently supported via the ES6-style interface.
 *
 * Note: unlike ES6 behavior, an exception thrown in the constructor function will NOT implicitly reject the promise.
 *
 * However, the more traditional CommonJS-style usage is still available, and documented below.
 *
 * [The CommonJS Promise proposal](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises) describes a promise as an
 * interface for interacting with an object that represents the result of an action that is
 * performed asynchronously, and may or may not be finished at any given point in time.
 *
 * From the perspective of dealing with error handling, deferred and promise APIs are to
 * asynchronous programming what `try`, `catch` and `throw` keywords are to synchronous programming.
 *
 * ```js
 *   // for the purpose of this example let's assume that variables `$q` and `okToGreet`
 *   // are available in the current lexical scope (they could have been injected or passed in).
 *
 *   function asyncGreet(name) {
 *     var deferred = $q.defer();
 *
 *     setTimeout(function() {
 *       deferred.notify('About to greet ' + name + '.');
 *
 *       if (okToGreet(name)) {
 *         deferred.resolve('Hello, ' + name + '!');
 *       } else {
 *         deferred.reject('Greeting ' + name + ' is not allowed.');
 *       }
 *     }, 1000);
 *
 *     return deferred.promise;
 *   }
 *
 *   var promise = asyncGreet('Robin Hood');
 *   promise.then(function(greeting) {
 *     alert('Success: ' + greeting);
 *   }, function(reason) {
 *     alert('Failed: ' + reason);
 *   }, function(update) {
 *     alert('Got notification: ' + update);
 *   });
 * ```
 *
 * At first it might not be obvious why this extra complexity is worth the trouble. The payoff
 * comes in the way of guarantees that promise and deferred APIs make, see
 * https://github.com/kriskowal/uncommonjs/blob/master/promises/specification.md.
 *
 * Additionally the promise api allows for composition that is very hard to do with the
 * traditional callback ([CPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style)) approach.
 * For more on this please see the [Q documentation](https://github.com/kriskowal/q) especially the
 * section on serial or parallel joining of promises.
 *
 * # The Deferred API
 *
 * A new instance of deferred is constructed by calling `$q.defer()`.
 *
 * The purpose of the deferred object is to expose the associated Promise instance as well as APIs
 * that can be used for signaling the successful or unsuccessful completion, as well as the status
 * of the task.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `resolve(value)` – resolves the derived promise with the `value`. If the value is a rejection
 *   constructed via `$q.reject`, the promise will be rejected instead.
 * - `reject(reason)` – rejects the derived promise with the `reason`. This is equivalent to
 *   resolving it with a rejection constructed via `$q.reject`.
 * - `notify(value)` - provides updates on the status of the promise's execution. This may be called
 *   multiple times before the promise is either resolved or rejected.
 *
 * **Properties**
 *
 * - promise – `{Promise}` – promise object associated with this deferred.
 *
 *
 * # The Promise API
 *
 * A new promise instance is created when a deferred instance is created and can be retrieved by
 * calling `deferred.promise`.
 *
 * The purpose of the promise object is to allow for interested parties to get access to the result
 * of the deferred task when it completes.
 *
 * **Methods**
 *
 * - `then(successCallback, [errorCallback], [notifyCallback])` – regardless of when the promise was or
 *   will be resolved or rejected, `then` calls one of the success or error callbacks asynchronously
 *   as soon as the result is available. The callbacks are called with a single argument: the result
 *   or rejection reason. Additionally, the notify callback may be called zero or more times to
 *   provide a progress indication, before the promise is resolved or rejected.
 *
 *   This method *returns a new promise* which is resolved or rejected via the return value of the
 *   `successCallback`, `errorCallback` (unless that value is a promise, in which case it is resolved
 *   with the value which is resolved in that promise using
 *   [promise chaining](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises/#toc-promises-queues)).
 *   It also notifies via the return value of the `notifyCallback` method. The promise cannot be
 *   resolved or rejected from the notifyCallback method. The errorCallback and notifyCallback
 *   arguments are optional.
 *
 * - `catch(errorCallback)` – shorthand for `promise.then(null, errorCallback)`
 *
 * - `finally(callback, notifyCallback)` – allows you to observe either the fulfillment or rejection of a promise,
 *   but to do so without modifying the final value. This is useful to release resources or do some
 *   clean-up that needs to be done whether the promise was rejected or resolved. See the [full
 *   specification](https://github.com/kriskowal/q/wiki/API-Reference#promisefinallycallback) for
 *   more information.
 *
 * # Chaining promises
 *
 * Because calling the `then` method of a promise returns a new derived promise, it is easily
 * possible to create a chain of promises:
 *
 * ```js
 *   promiseB = promiseA.then(function(result) {
 *     return result + 1;
 *   });
 *
 *   // promiseB will be resolved immediately after promiseA is resolved and its value
 *   // will be the result of promiseA incremented by 1
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible to create chains of any length and since a promise can be resolved with another
 * promise (which will defer its resolution further), it is possible to pause/defer resolution of
 * the promises at any point in the chain. This makes it possible to implement powerful APIs like
 * $http's response interceptors.
 *
 *
 * # Differences between Kris Kowal's Q and $q
 *
 *  There are two main differences:
 *
 * - $q is integrated with the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope} Scope model observation
 *   mechanism in angular, which means faster propagation of resolution or rejection into your
 *   models and avoiding unnecessary browser repaints, which would result in flickering UI.
 * - Q has many more features than $q, but that comes at a cost of bytes. $q is tiny, but contains
 *   all the important functionality needed for common async tasks.
 *
 * # Testing
 *
 *  ```js
 *    it('should simulate promise', inject(function($q, $rootScope) {
 *      var deferred = $q.defer();
 *      var promise = deferred.promise;
 *      var resolvedValue;
 *
 *      promise.then(function(value) { resolvedValue = value; });
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Simulate resolving of promise
 *      deferred.resolve(123);
 *      // Note that the 'then' function does not get called synchronously.
 *      // This is because we want the promise API to always be async, whether or not
 *      // it got called synchronously or asynchronously.
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toBeUndefined();
 *
 *      // Propagate promise resolution to 'then' functions using $apply().
 *      $rootScope.$apply();
 *      expect(resolvedValue).toEqual(123);
 *    }));
 *  ```
 *
 * @param {function(function, function)} resolver Function which is responsible for resolving or
 *   rejecting the newly created promise. The first parameter is a function which resolves the
 *   promise, the second parameter is a function which rejects the promise.
 *
 * @returns {Promise} The newly created promise.

/**
 * DESIGN NOTES
 *
 * The design decisions behind the scope are heavily favored for speed and memory consumption.
 *
 * The typical use of scope is to watch the expressions, which most of the time return the same
 * value as last time so we optimize the operation.
 *
 * Closures construction is expensive in terms of speed as well as memory:
 *   - No closures, instead use prototypical inheritance for API
 *   - Internal state needs to be stored on scope directly, which means that private state is
 *     exposed as $$____ properties
 *
 * Loop operations are optimized by using while(count--) { ... }
 *   - This means that in order to keep the same order of execution as addition we have to add
 *     items to the array at the beginning (unshift) instead of at the end (push)
 *
 * Child scopes are created and removed often
 *   - Using an array would be slow since inserts in the middle are expensive; so we use linked lists
 *
 * There are fewer watches than observers. This is why you don't want the observer to be implemented
 * in the same way as watch. Watch requires return of the initialization function which is expensive
 * to construct.

       * @description
       * Registers a `listener` callback to be executed whenever the `watchExpression` changes.
       *
       * - The `watchExpression` is called on every call to {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest
       *   $digest()} and should return the value that will be watched. (`watchExpression` should not change
       *   its value when executed multiple times with the same input because it may be executed multiple
       *   times by {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest()}. That is, `watchExpression` should be
       *   [idempotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence).)
       * - The `listener` is called only when the value from the current `watchExpression` and the
       *   previous call to `watchExpression` are not equal (with the exception of the initial run,
       *   see below). Inequality is determined according to reference inequality,
       *   [strict comparison](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Comparison_Operators)
       *    via the `!==` Javascript operator, unless `objectEquality == true`
       *   (see next point)
       * - When `objectEquality == true`, inequality of the `watchExpression` is determined
       *   according to the {@link angular.equals} function. To save the value of the object for
       *   later comparison, the {@link angular.copy} function is used. This therefore means that
       *   watching complex objects will have adverse memory and performance implications.
       * - The watch `listener` may change the model, which may trigger other `listener`s to fire.
       *   This is achieved by rerunning the watchers until no changes are detected. The rerun
       *   iteration limit is 10 to prevent an infinite loop deadlock.
       *
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with no `listener`. (Be prepared for
       * multiple calls to your `watchExpression` because it will execute multiple times in a
       * single {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$digest $digest} cycle if a change is detected.)
       *
       * After a watcher is registered with the scope, the `listener` fn is called asynchronously
       * (via {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$evalAsync $evalAsync}) to initialize the
       * watcher. In rare cases, this is undesirable because the listener is called when the result
       * of `watchExpression` didn't change. To detect this scenario within the `listener` fn, you
       * can compare the `newVal` and `oldVal`. If these two values are identical (`===`) then the
       * listener was called due to initialization.
       *
       *
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           // let's assume that scope was dependency injected as the $rootScope
           var scope = $rootScope;
           scope.name = 'misko';

           });

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered

           // but now it will not be called unless the value changes

       * @ngdoc method
       * @name $rootScope.Scope#$digest
       * @kind function
       *
       * @description
       * Processes all of the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers} of the current scope and
       * its children. Because a {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watcher}'s listener can change
       * the model, the `$digest()` keeps calling the {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch watchers}
       * until no more listeners are firing. This means that it is possible to get into an infinite
       * loop. This function will throw `'Maximum iteration limit exceeded.'` if the number of
       * iterations exceeds 10.
       *
       * Usually, you don't call `$digest()` directly in
       * {@link ng.directive:ngController controllers} or in
       * {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directives}.
       * Instead, you should call {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$apply $apply()} (typically from within
       * a {@link ng.$compileProvider#directive directive}), which will force a `$digest()`.
       *
       * If you want to be notified whenever `$digest()` is called,
       * you can register a `watchExpression` function with
       * {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#$watch $watch()} with no `listener`.
       *
       * In unit tests, you may need to call `$digest()` to simulate the scope life cycle.
       *
       * # Example
       * ```js
           var scope = ...;
           scope.name = 'misko';
           scope.counter = 0;

           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);
           scope.$watch('name', function(newValue, oldValue) {
             scope.counter = scope.counter + 1;
           });
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(0);

           scope.$digest();
           // the listener is always called during the first $digest loop after it was registered
           expect(scope.counter).toEqual(1);

 *
 * `$sceDelegate` is a service that is used by the `$sce` service to provide {@link ng.$sce Strict
 * Contextual Escaping (SCE)} services to AngularJS.
 *
 * Typically, you would configure or override the {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} instead of
 * the `$sce` service to customize the way Strict Contextual Escaping works in AngularJS.  This is
 * because, while the `$sce` provides numerous shorthand methods, etc., you really only need to
 * override 3 core functions (`trustAs`, `getTrusted` and `valueOf`) to replace the way things
 * work because `$sce` delegates to `$sceDelegate` for these operations.
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} to configure this service.
 *
 * The default instance of `$sceDelegate` should work out of the box with little pain.  While you
 * can override it completely to change the behavior of `$sce`, the common case would
 * involve configuring the {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} instead by setting
 * your own whitelists and blacklists for trusting URLs used for loading AngularJS resources such as
 * templates.  Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist
 * $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and {@link

 * The `$sceDelegateProvider` provider allows developers to configure the {@link ng.$sceDelegate

 * that the URLs used for sourcing Angular templates are safe.  Refer {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist} and
 * {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlBlacklist}
 *
 * For the general details about this service in Angular, read the main page for {@link ng.$sce
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE)}.
 *
 * **Example**:  Consider the following case. <a name="example"></a>
 *
 * - your app is hosted at url `http://myapp.example.com/`
 * - but some of your templates are hosted on other domains you control such as
 *   `http://srv01.assets.example.com/`, `http://srv02.assets.example.com/`, etc.
 * - and you have an open redirect at `http://myapp.example.com/clickThru?...`.
 *
 * Here is what a secure configuration for this scenario might look like:
 *
 * ```
 *  angular.module('myApp', []).config(function($sceDelegateProvider) {
 *    $sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist([
 *      // Allow same origin resource loads.
 *      'self',
 *      // Allow loading from our assets domain.  Notice the difference between * and **.
 *      'http://srv*.assets.example.com/**'

 *    // The blacklist overrides the whitelist so the open redirect here is blocked.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $sce
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *
 * `$sce` is a service that provides Strict Contextual Escaping services to AngularJS.
 *
 * # Strict Contextual Escaping
 *
 * Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is a mode in which AngularJS requires bindings in certain
 * contexts to result in a value that is marked as safe to use for that context.  One example of
 * such a context is binding arbitrary html controlled by the user via `ng-bind-html`.  We refer
 * to these contexts as privileged or SCE contexts.
 *
 * As of version 1.2, Angular ships with SCE enabled by default.
 *
 * Note:  When enabled (the default), IE<11 in quirks mode is not supported.  In this mode, IE<11 allow
 * one to execute arbitrary javascript by the use of the expression() syntax.  Refer
 * <http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/10/16/ending-expressions.aspx> to learn more about them.
 * You can ensure your document is in standards mode and not quirks mode by adding `<!doctype html>`
 * to the top of your HTML document.
 *
 * SCE assists in writing code in a way that (a) is secure by default and (b) makes auditing for
 * security vulnerabilities such as XSS, clickjacking, etc. a lot easier.
 *
 * Here's an example of a binding in a privileged context:
 *
 * ```
 * <input ng-model="userHtml" aria-label="User input">
 * <div ng-bind-html="userHtml"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that `ng-bind-html` is bound to `userHtml` controlled by the user.  With SCE
 * disabled, this application allows the user to render arbitrary HTML into the DIV.
 * In a more realistic example, one may be rendering user comments, blog articles, etc. via
 * bindings.  (HTML is just one example of a context where rendering user controlled input creates
 * security vulnerabilities.)
 *
 * For the case of HTML, you might use a library, either on the client side, or on the server side,
 * to sanitize unsafe HTML before binding to the value and rendering it in the document.
 *
 * How would you ensure that every place that used these types of bindings was bound to a value that
 * was sanitized by your library (or returned as safe for rendering by your server?)  How can you
 * ensure that you didn't accidentally delete the line that sanitized the value, or renamed some
 * properties/fields and forgot to update the binding to the sanitized value?
 *
 * To be secure by default, you want to ensure that any such bindings are disallowed unless you can
 * determine that something explicitly says it's safe to use a value for binding in that
 * context.  You can then audit your code (a simple grep would do) to ensure that this is only done
 * for those values that you can easily tell are safe - because they were received from your server,
 * sanitized by your library, etc.  You can organize your codebase to help with this - perhaps
 * allowing only the files in a specific directory to do this.  Ensuring that the internal API
 * exposed by that code doesn't markup arbitrary values as safe then becomes a more manageable task.
 *
 * In the case of AngularJS' SCE service, one uses {@link ng.$sce#trustAs $sce.trustAs}
 * (and shorthand methods such as {@link ng.$sce#trustAsHtml $sce.trustAsHtml}, etc.) to
 * obtain values that will be accepted by SCE / privileged contexts.
 *
 *
 * ## How does it work?
 *
 * In privileged contexts, directives and code will bind to the result of {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted
 * $sce.getTrusted(context, value)} rather than to the value directly.  Directives use {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAs $sce.parseAs} rather than `$parse` to watch attribute bindings, which performs the
 * {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted} behind the scenes on non-constant literals.
 *
 * As an example, {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} uses {@link
 * ng.$sce#parseAsHtml $sce.parseAsHtml(binding expression)}.  Here's the actual code (slightly
 * simplified):
 *
 * ```
 * var ngBindHtmlDirective = ['$sce', function($sce) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attr) {
 *     scope.$watch($sce.parseAsHtml(attr.ngBindHtml), function(value) {
 *       element.html(value || '');
 *     });
 *   };
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * ## Impact on loading templates
 *
 * This applies both to the {@link ng.directive:ngInclude `ng-include`} directive as well as
 * `templateUrl`'s specified by {@link guide/directive directives}.
 *
 * By default, Angular only loads templates from the same domain and protocol as the application
 * document.  This is done by calling {@link ng.$sce#getTrustedResourceUrl
 * $sce.getTrustedResourceUrl} on the template URL.  To load templates from other domains and/or
 * protocols, you may either {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelist
 * them} or {@link ng.$sce#trustAsResourceUrl wrap it} into a trusted value.
 *
 * *Please note*:
 * The browser's
 * [Same Origin Policy](https://code.google.com/p/browsersec/wiki/Part2#Same-origin_policy_for_XMLHttpRequest)
 * and [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/)
 * policy apply in addition to this and may further restrict whether the template is successfully
 * loaded.  This means that without the right CORS policy, loading templates from a different domain
 * won't work on all browsers.  Also, loading templates from `file://` URL does not work on some
 * browsers.
 *
 * ## This feels like too much overhead
 *
 * It's important to remember that SCE only applies to interpolation expressions.
 *
 * If your expressions are constant literals, they're automatically trusted and you don't need to
 * call `$sce.trustAs` on them (remember to include the `ngSanitize` module) (e.g.
 * `<div ng-bind-html="'<b>implicitly trusted</b>'"></div>`) just works.
 *
 * Additionally, `a[href]` and `img[src]` automatically sanitize their URLs and do not pass them
 * through {@link ng.$sce#getTrusted $sce.getTrusted}.  SCE doesn't play a role here.
 *
 * The included {@link ng.$sceDelegate $sceDelegate} comes with sane defaults to allow you to load
 * templates in `ng-include` from your application's domain without having to even know about SCE.
 * It blocks loading templates from other domains or loading templates over http from an https
 * served document.  You can change these by setting your own custom {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist whitelists} and {@link
 * ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist blacklists} for matching such URLs.
 *
 * This significantly reduces the overhead.  It is far easier to pay the small overhead and have an
 * application that's secure and can be audited to verify that with much more ease than bolting
 * security onto an application later.
 *
 * <a name="contexts"></a>
 * ## What trusted context types are supported?
 *
 * | Context             | Notes          |
 * |---------------------|----------------|
 * | `$sce.HTML`         | For HTML that's safe to source into the application.  The {@link ng.directive:ngBindHtml ngBindHtml} directive uses this context for bindings. If an unsafe value is encountered and the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize} module is present this will sanitize the value instead of throwing an error. |
 * | `$sce.CSS`          | For CSS that's safe to source into the application.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 * | `$sce.URL`          | For URLs that are safe to follow as links.  Currently unused (`<a href=` and `<img src=` sanitize their urls and don't constitute an SCE context. |
 * | `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` | For URLs that are not only safe to follow as links, but whose contents are also safe to include in your application.  Examples include `ng-include`, `src` / `ngSrc` bindings for tags other than `IMG`, `VIDEO`, `AUDIO`, `SOURCE`, and `TRACK` (e.g. `IFRAME`, `OBJECT`, etc.)  <br><br>Note that `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` makes a stronger statement about the URL than `$sce.URL` does and therefore contexts requiring values trusted for `$sce.RESOURCE_URL` can be used anywhere that values trusted for `$sce.URL` are required. |
 * | `$sce.JS`           | For JavaScript that is safe to execute in your application's context.  Currently unused.  Feel free to use it in your own directives. |
 *
 * ## Format of items in {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlWhitelist resourceUrlWhitelist}/{@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider#resourceUrlBlacklist Blacklist} <a name="resourceUrlPatternItem"></a>
 *
 *  Each element in these arrays must be one of the following:
 *
 *  - **'self'**
 *    - The special **string**, `'self'`, can be used to match against all URLs of the **same
 *      domain** as the application document using the **same protocol**.
 *  - **String** (except the special value `'self'`)
 *    - The string is matched against the full *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource
 *      being tested (substring matches are not good enough.)
 *    - There are exactly **two wildcard sequences** - `*` and `**`.  All other characters
 *      match themselves.
 *    - `*`: matches zero or more occurrences of any character other than one of the following 6
 *      characters: '`:`', '`/`', '`.`', '`?`', '`&`' and '`;`'.  It's a useful wildcard for use
 *      in a whitelist.
 *    - `**`: matches zero or more occurrences of *any* character.  As such, it's not
 *      appropriate for use in a scheme, domain, etc. as it would match too much.  (e.g.
 *      http://**.example.com/ would match http://evil.com/?ignore=.example.com/ and that might
 *      not have been the intention.)  Its usage at the very end of the path is ok.  (e.g.
 *      http://foo.example.com/templates/**).
 *  - **RegExp** (*see caveat below*)
 *    - *Caveat*:  While regular expressions are powerful and offer great flexibility,  their syntax
 *      (and all the inevitable escaping) makes them *harder to maintain*.  It's easy to
 *      accidentally introduce a bug when one updates a complex expression (imho, all regexes should
 *      have good test coverage).  For instance, the use of `.` in the regex is correct only in a
 *      small number of cases.  A `.` character in the regex used when matching the scheme or a
 *      subdomain could be matched against a `:` or literal `.` that was likely not intended.   It
 *      is highly recommended to use the string patterns and only fall back to regular expressions
 *      as a last resort.
 *    - The regular expression must be an instance of RegExp (i.e. not a string.)  It is
 *      matched against the **entire** *normalized / absolute URL* of the resource being tested
 *      (even when the RegExp did not have the `^` and `$` codes.)  In addition, any flags
 *      present on the RegExp (such as multiline, global, ignoreCase) are ignored.
 *    - If you are generating your JavaScript from some other templating engine (not
 *      recommended, e.g. in issue [#4006](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/4006)),
 *      remember to escape your regular expression (and be aware that you might need more than
 *      one level of escaping depending on your templating engine and the way you interpolated
 *      the value.)  Do make use of your platform's escaping mechanism as it might be good
 *      enough before coding your own.  E.g. Ruby has
 *      [Regexp.escape(str)](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0.0/Regexp.html#method-c-escape)
 *      and Python has [re.escape](http://docs.python.org/library/re.html#re.escape).
 *      Javascript lacks a similar built in function for escaping.  Take a look at Google
 *      Closure library's [goog.string.regExpEscape(s)](
 *      http://docs.closure-library.googlecode.com/git/closure_goog_string_string.js.source.html#line962).
 *
 * Refer {@link ng.$sceDelegateProvider $sceDelegateProvider} for an example.

 * ## Can I disable SCE completely?

 * Yes, you can.  However, this is strongly discouraged.  SCE gives you a lot of security benefits
 * for little coding overhead.  It will be much harder to take an SCE disabled application and
 * either secure it on your own or enable SCE at a later stage.  It might make sense to disable SCE
 * for cases where you have a lot of existing code that was written before SCE was introduced and
 * you're migrating them a module at a time.
 *
 * That said, here's how you can completely disable SCE:
 *
 * ```
 * angular.module('myAppWithSceDisabledmyApp', []).config(function($sceProvider) {
 *   // Completely disable SCE.  For demonstration purposes only!
 *   // Do not use in new projects.
 *   $sceProvider.enabled(false);
 * });

   * The API contract for the SCE delegate
   * -------------------------------------
   * The SCE delegate object must provide the following 3 methods:
   *
   * - trustAs(contextEnum, value)
   *     This method is used to tell the SCE service that the provided value is OK to use in the
   *     contexts specified by contextEnum.  It must return an object that will be accepted by
   *     getTrusted() for a compatible contextEnum and return this value.
   *
   * - valueOf(value)
   *     For values that were not produced by trustAs(), return them as is.  For values that were
   *     produced by trustAs(), return the corresponding input value to trustAs.  Basically, if
   *     trustAs is wrapping the given values into some type, this operation unwraps it when given
   *     such a value.
   *
   * - getTrusted(contextEnum, value)
   *     This function should return the a value that is safe to use in the context specified by
   *     contextEnum or throw and exception otherwise.
   *
   * NOTE: This contract deliberately does NOT state that values returned by trustAs() must be
   * opaque or wrapped in some holder object.  That happens to be an implementation detail.  For
   * instance, an implementation could maintain a registry of all trusted objects by context.  In
   * such a case, trustAs() would return the same object that was passed in.  getTrusted() would
   * return the same object passed in if it was found in the registry under a compatible context or
   * throw an exception otherwise.  An implementation might only wrap values some of the time based
   * on some criteria.  getTrusted() might return a value and not throw an exception for special
   * constants or objects even if not wrapped.  All such implementations fulfill this contract.
   *
   *
   * A note on the inheritance model for SCE contexts
   * ------------------------------------------------
   * I've used inheritance and made RESOURCE_URL wrapped types a subtype of URL wrapped types.  This
   * is purely an implementation details.
   *
   * The contract is simply this:
   *
   *     getTrusted($sce.RESOURCE_URL, value) succeeding implies that getTrusted($sce.URL, value)
   *     will also succeed.
   *
   * Inheritance happens to capture this in a natural way.  In some future, we
   * may not use inheritance anymore.  That is OK because no code outside of
   * sce.js and sceSpecs.js would need to be aware of this detail.

/**
 *
 * Implementation Notes for non-IE browsers
 * ----------------------------------------
 * Assigning a URL to the href property of an anchor DOM node, even one attached to the DOM,
 * results both in the normalizing and parsing of the URL.  Normalizing means that a relative
 * URL will be resolved into an absolute URL in the context of the application document.
 * Parsing means that the anchor node's host, hostname, protocol, port, pathname and related
 * properties are all populated to reflect the normalized URL.  This approach has wide
 * compatibility - Safari 1+, Mozilla 1+, Opera 7+,e etc.  See
 * http://www.aptana.com/reference/html/api/HTMLAnchorElement.html
 *
 * Implementation Notes for IE
 * ---------------------------
 * IE <= 10 normalizes the URL when assigned to the anchor node similar to the other
 * browsers.  However, the parsed components will not be set if the URL assigned did not specify
 * them.  (e.g. if you assign a.href = "foo", then a.protocol, a.host, etc. will be empty.)  We
 * work around that by performing the parsing in a 2nd step by taking a previously normalized
 * URL (e.g. by assigning to a.href) and assigning it a.href again.  This correctly populates the
 * properties such as protocol, hostname, port, etc.

 *     which have property `name` containing "M" and property `phone` containing "1". A special
 *     property name (`$` by default) can be used (e.g. as in `{$: "text"}`) to accept a match
 *     against any property of the object or its nested object properties. That's equivalent to the
 *     simple substring match with a `string` as described above. The special property name can be
 *     overwritten, using the `anyPropertyKey` parameter.
 *     The predicate can be negated by prefixing the string with `!`.
 *     For example `{name: "!M"}` predicate will return an array of items which have property `name`
 *     not containing "M".
 *
 *     Note that a named property will match properties on the same level only, while the special
 *     `$` property will match properties on the same level or deeper. E.g. an array item like
 *     `{name: {first: 'John', last: 'Doe'}}` will **not** be matched by `{name: 'John'}`, but
 *     **will** be matched by `{$: 'John'}`.
 *
 *   - `function(value, index, array)`: A predicate function can be used to write arbitrary filters.
 *     The function is called for each element of the array, with the element, its index, and
 *     the entire array itself as arguments.
 *
 *     The final result is an array of those elements that the predicate returned true for.
 *
 * @param {function(actual, expected)|true|false} [comparator] Comparator which is used in
 *     determining if the expected value (from the filter expression) and actual value (from
 *     the object in the array) should be considered a match.
 *
 *   Can be one of:
 *
 *   - `function(actual, expected)`:
 *     The function will be given the object value and the predicate value to compare and
 *     should return true if both values should be considered equal.
 *
 *   - `true`: A shorthand for `function(actual, expected) { return angular.equals(actual, expected)}`.
 *     This is essentially strict comparison of expected and actual.
 *
 *   - `false`: A short hand for a function which will look for a substring match in a case
 *     insensitive way. Primitive values are converted to strings. Objects are not compared against
 *     primitives, unless they have a custom `toString` method (e.g. `Date` objects).
 *
 *
 *   Defaults to `false`.
 *
 * @param {string} [anyPropertyKey] The special property name that matches against any property.
 *     By default `$`.

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name date
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 *   Formats `date` to a string based on the requested `format`.
 *
 *   `format` string can be composed of the following elements:
 *
 *   * `'yyyy'`: 4 digit representation of year (e.g. AD 1 => 0001, AD 2010 => 2010)
 *   * `'yy'`: 2 digit representation of year, padded (00-99). (e.g. AD 2001 => 01, AD 2010 => 10)
 *   * `'y'`: 1 digit representation of year, e.g. (AD 1 => 1, AD 199 => 199)
 *   * `'MMMM'`: Month in year (January-December)
 *   * `'MMM'`: Month in year (Jan-Dec)
 *   * `'MM'`: Month in year, padded (01-12)
 *   * `'M'`: Month in year (1-12)
 *   * `'LLLL'`: Stand-alone month in year (January-December)
 *   * `'dd'`: Day in month, padded (01-31)
 *   * `'d'`: Day in month (1-31)
 *   * `'EEEE'`: Day in Week,(Sunday-Saturday)
 *   * `'EEE'`: Day in Week, (Sun-Sat)
 *   * `'HH'`: Hour in day, padded (00-23)
 *   * `'H'`: Hour in day (0-23)
 *   * `'hh'`: Hour in AM/PM, padded (01-12)
 *   * `'h'`: Hour in AM/PM, (1-12)
 *   * `'mm'`: Minute in hour, padded (00-59)
 *   * `'m'`: Minute in hour (0-59)
 *   * `'ss'`: Second in minute, padded (00-59)
 *   * `'s'`: Second in minute (0-59)
 *   * `'sss'`: Millisecond in second, padded (000-999)
 *   * `'a'`: AM/PM marker
 *   * `'Z'`: 4 digit (+sign) representation of the timezone offset (-1200-+1200)
 *   * `'ww'`: Week of year, padded (00-53). Week 01 is the week with the first Thursday of the year
 *   * `'w'`: Week of year (0-53). Week 1 is the week with the first Thursday of the year
 *   * `'G'`, `'GG'`, `'GGG'`: The abbreviated form of the era string (e.g. 'AD')
 *   * `'GGGG'`: The long form of the era string (e.g. 'Anno Domini')
 *
 *   `format` string can also be one of the following predefined
 *   {@link guide/i18n localizable formats}:
 *
 *   * `'medium'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale
 *     (e.g. Sep 3, 2010 12:05:08 PM)
 *   * `'short'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy h:mm a'` for en_US  locale (e.g. 9/3/10 12:05 PM)
 *   * `'fullDate'`: equivalent to `'EEEE, MMMM d, y'` for en_US  locale
 *     (e.g. Friday, September 3, 2010)
 *   * `'longDate'`: equivalent to `'MMMM d, y'` for en_US  locale (e.g. September 3, 2010)
 *   * `'mediumDate'`: equivalent to `'MMM d, y'` for en_US  locale (e.g. Sep 3, 2010)
 *   * `'shortDate'`: equivalent to `'M/d/yy'` for en_US locale (e.g. 9/3/10)
 *   * `'mediumTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm:ss a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05:08 PM)
 *   * `'shortTime'`: equivalent to `'h:mm a'` for en_US locale (e.g. 12:05 PM)
 *
 *   `format` string can contain literal values. These need to be escaped by surrounding with single quotes (e.g.
 *   `"h 'in the morning'"`). In order to output a single quote, escape it - i.e., two single quotes in a sequence
 *   (e.g. `"h 'o''clock'"`).
 *
 * @param {(Date|number|string)} date Date to format either as Date object, milliseconds (string or
 *    number) or various ISO 8601 datetime string formats (e.g. yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.sssZ and its
 *    shorter versions like yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mmZ, yyyy-MM-dd or yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ). If no timezone is
 *    specified in the string input, the time is considered to be in the local timezone.
 * @param {string=} format Formatting rules (see Description). If not specified,
 *    `mediumDate` is used.
 * @param {string=} timezone Timezone to be used for formatting. It understands UTC/GMT and the
 *    continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for
 *    example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *    If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 * @returns {string} Formatted string or the input if input is not recognized as date/millis.

 * Creates a new array or string containing only a specified number of elements. The elements are
 * taken from either the beginning or the end of the source array, string or number, as specified by
 * the value and sign (positive or negative) of `limit`. Other array-like objects are also supported
 * (e.g. array subclasses, NodeLists, jqLite/jQuery collections etc). If a number is used as input,
 * it is converted to a string.
 *
 * @param {Array|ArrayLike|string|number} input - Array/array-like, string or number to be limited.
 * @param {string|number} limit - The length of the returned array or string. If the `limit` number
 *     is positive, `limit` number of items from the beginning of the source array/string are copied.
 *     If the number is negative, `limit` number  of items from the end of the source array/string
 *     are copied. The `limit` will be trimmed if it exceeds `array.length`. If `limit` is undefined,
 *     the input will be returned unchanged.
 * @param {(string|number)=} begin - Index at which to begin limitation. As a negative index,
 *     `begin` indicates an offset from the end of `input`. Defaults to `0`.
 * @returns {Array|string} A new sub-array or substring of length `limit` or less if the input had

/**
 * @ngdoc filter
 * @name orderBy
 * @kind function
 *
 * @description
 * Returns an array containing the items from the specified `collection`, ordered by a `comparator`
 * function based on the values computed using the `expression` predicate.
 *
 * For example, `[{id: 'foo'}, {id: 'bar'}] | orderBy:'id'` would result in
 * `[{id: 'bar'}, {id: 'foo'}]`.
 *
 * The `collection` can be an Array or array-like object (e.g. NodeList, jQuery object, TypedArray,
 * String, etc).
 *
 * The `expression` can be a single predicate, or a list of predicates each serving as a tie-breaker
 * for the preceding one. The `expression` is evaluated against each item and the output is used
 * for comparing with other items.
 *
 * You can change the sorting order by setting `reverse` to `true`. By default, items are sorted in
 * ascending order.
 *
 * The comparison is done using the `comparator` function. If none is specified, a default, built-in
 * comparator is used (see below for details - in a nutshell, it compares numbers numerically and
 * strings alphabetically).
 *
 * ### Under the hood
 *
 * Ordering the specified `collection` happens in two phases:
 *
 * 1. All items are passed through the predicate (or predicates), and the returned values are saved
 *    along with their type (`string`, `number` etc). For example, an item `{label: 'foo'}`, passed
 *    through a predicate that extracts the value of the `label` property, would be transformed to:
 *    ```
 *    {
 *      value: 'foo',
 *      type: 'string',
 *      index: ...
 *    }
 *    ```
 * 2. The comparator function is used to sort the items, based on the derived values, types and
 *    indices.
 *
 * If you use a custom comparator, it will be called with pairs of objects of the form
 * `{value: ..., type: '...', index: ...}` and is expected to return `0` if the objects are equal
 * (as far as the comparator is concerned), `-1` if the 1st one should be ranked higher than the
 * second, or `1` otherwise.
 *
 * In order to ensure that the sorting will be deterministic across platforms, if none of the
 * specified predicates can distinguish between two items, `orderBy` will automatically introduce a
 * dummy predicate that returns the item's index as `value`.
 * (If you are using a custom comparator, make sure it can handle this predicate as well.)
 *
 * Finally, in an attempt to simplify things, if a predicate returns an object as the extracted
 * value for an item, `orderBy` will try to convert that object to a primitive value, before passing
 * it to the comparator. The following rules govern the conversion:
 *
 * 1. If the object has a `valueOf()` method that returns a primitive, its return value will be
 *    used instead.<br />
 *    (If the object has a `valueOf()` method that returns another object, then the returned object
 *    will be used in subsequent steps.)
 * 2. If the object has a custom `toString()` method (i.e. not the one inherited from `Object`) that
 *    returns a primitive, its return value will be used instead.<br />
 *    (If the object has a `toString()` method that returns another object, then the returned object
 *    will be used in subsequent steps.)
 * 3. No conversion; the object itself is used.
 *
 * ### The default comparator
 *
 * The default, built-in comparator should be sufficient for most usecases. In short, it compares
 * numbers numerically, strings alphabetically (and case-insensitively), for objects falls back to
 * using their index in the original collection, and sorts values of different types by type.
 *
 * More specifically, it follows these steps to determine the relative order of items:
 *
 * 1. If the compared values are of different types, compare the types themselves alphabetically.
 * 2. If both values are of type `string`, compare them alphabetically in a case- and
 *    locale-insensitive way.
 * 3. If both values are objects, compare their indices instead.
 * 4. Otherwise, return:
 *    -  `0`, if the values are equal (by strict equality comparison, i.e. using `===`).
 *    - `-1`, if the 1st value is "less than" the 2nd value (compared using the `<` operator).
 *    -  `1`, otherwise.
 *
 * **Note:** If you notice numbers not being sorted as expected, make sure they are actually being
 *           saved as numbers and not strings.
 * **Note:** For the purpose of sorting, `null` values are treated as the string `'null'` (i.e.
 *           `type: 'string'`, `value: 'null'`). This may cause unexpected sort order relative to
 *           other values.
 *
 * @param {Array|ArrayLike} collection - The collection (array or array-like object) to sort.
 * @param {(Function|string|Array.<Function|string>)=} expression - A predicate (or list of
 *    predicates) to be used by the comparator to determine the order of elements.
 *
 *    Can be one of:
 *
 *    - `Function`: A getter function. This function will be called with each item as argument and
 *      the return value will be used for sorting.
 *    - `string`: An Angular expression. This expression will be evaluated against each item and the
 *      result will be used for sorting. For example, use `'label'` to sort by a property called
 *      `label` or `'label.substring(0, 3)'` to sort by the first 3 characters of the `label`
 *      property.<br />
 *      (The result of a constant expression is interpreted as a property name to be used for
 *      comparison. For example, use `'"special name"'` (note the extra pair of quotes) to sort by a
 *      property called `special name`.)<br />
 *      An expression can be optionally prefixed with `+` or `-` to control the sorting direction,
 *      ascending or descending. For example, `'+label'` or `'-label'`. If no property is provided,
 *      (e.g. `'+'` or `'-'`), the collection element itself is used in comparisons.
 *    - `Array`: An array of function and/or string predicates. If a predicate cannot determine the
 *      relative order of two items, the next predicate is used as a tie-breaker.
 *
 * **Note:** If the predicate is missing or empty then it defaults to `'+'`.
 *
 * @param {boolean=} reverse - If `true`, reverse the sorting order.
 * @param {(Function)=} comparator - The comparator function used to determine the relative order of
 *    value pairs. If omitted, the built-in comparator will be used.
 *
 * @returns {Array} - The sorted array.
 *
 *
 * @example
 * ### Ordering a table with `ngRepeat`
 *
 * The example below demonstrates a simple {@link ngRepeat ngRepeat}, where the data is sorted by
 * age in descending order (expression is set to `'-age'`). The `comparator` is not set, which means
 * it defaults to the built-in comparator.

 * ### Using a custom comparator
 *
 * If you have very specific requirements about the way items are sorted, you can pass your own
 * comparator function. For example, you might need to compare some strings in a locale-sensitive
 * way. (When specifying a custom comparator, you also need to pass a value for the `reverse`
 * argument - passing `false` retains the default sorting order, i.e. ascending.)

 /**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name form
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that instantiates
 * {@link form.FormController FormController}.
 *
 * If the `name` attribute is specified, the form controller is published onto the current scope under
 * this name.
 *
 * # Alias: {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`}
 *
 * In Angular, forms can be nested. This means that the outer form is valid when all of the child
 * forms are valid as well. However, browsers do not allow nesting of `<form>` elements, so
 * Angular provides the {@link ng.directive:ngForm `ngForm`} directive, which behaves identically to
 * `form` but can be nested. Nested forms can be useful, for example, if the validity of a sub-group
 * of controls needs to be determined.
 *
 * # CSS classes
 *  - `ng-valid` is set if the form is valid.
 *  - `ng-invalid` is set if the form is invalid.
 *  - `ng-pending` is set if the form is pending.
 *  - `ng-pristine` is set if the form is pristine.
 *  - `ng-dirty` is set if the form is dirty.
 *  - `ng-submitted` is set if the form was submitted.
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 *
 * # Submitting a form and preventing the default action
 *
 * Since the role of forms in client-side Angular applications is different than in classical
 * roundtrip apps, it is desirable for the browser not to translate the form submission into a full
 * page reload that sends the data to the server. Instead some javascript logic should be triggered
 * to handle the form submission in an application-specific way.
 *
 * For this reason, Angular prevents the default action (form submission to the server) unless the
 * `<form>` element has an `action` attribute specified.
 *
 * You can use one of the following two ways to specify what javascript method should be called when
 * a form is submitted:
 *
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit} directive on the form element
 * - {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directive on the first
  *  button or input field of type submit (input[type=submit])
 *
 * To prevent double execution of the handler, use only one of the {@link ng.directive:ngSubmit ngSubmit}
 * or {@link ng.directive:ngClick ngClick} directives.
 * This is because of the following form submission rules in the HTML specification:
 *
 * - If a form has only one input field then hitting enter in this field triggers form submit
 * (`ngSubmit`)
 * - if a form has 2+ input fields and no buttons or input[type=submit] then hitting enter
 * doesn't trigger submit
 * - if a form has one or more input fields and one or more buttons or input[type=submit] then
 * hitting enter in any of the input fields will trigger the click handler on the *first* button or
 * input[type=submit] (`ngClick`) *and* a submit handler on the enclosing form (`ngSubmit`)
 *
 * Any pending `ngModelOptions` changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is
 * submitted. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations in ngForm are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed.
 * These classes are: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`, `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any
 * other validations that are performed within the form. Animations in ngForm are similar to how
 * they work in ngClass and animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well
 * as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style a form element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-form {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-form.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
    <example name="ng-form" deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="formExample">
      <file name="index.html">
       <script>

        .my-form {
          transition:all linear 0.5s;

   * @ngdoc input
   * @name input[text]
   *
   * @description
   * Standard HTML text input with angular data binding, inherited by most of the `input` elements.
   *
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} required Adds `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue $viewValue}
   *    does not match a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
   *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
   *    account.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
   *    interaction with the input element.
   * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.
   *    This parameter is ignored for input[type=password] controls, which will never trim the
   *    input.

   * `input[number]` does not work as expected with {@link ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions.allowInvalid`}.
   * If a non-number is entered in the input, the browser will report the value as an empty string,
   * which means the view / model values in `ngModel` and subsequently the scope value
   * will also be an empty string.
   *
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation error key if the value entered is less than `min`.
   * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation error key if the value entered is greater than `max`.
   * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue $viewValue}
   *    does not match a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to

   * used in Chromium. If you need stricter validation (e.g. requiring a top-level domain), you can
   * use `ng-pattern` or modify the built-in validators (see the {@link guide/forms Forms guide})
   * </div>
   *
   * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
   * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
   *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
   *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
   * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
   *    minlength.
   * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
   *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of
   *    any length.
   * @param {string=} pattern Similar to `ngPattern` except that the attribute value is the actual string
   *    that contains the regular expression body that will be converted to a regular expression
   *    as in the ngPattern directive.
   * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue $viewValue}
   *    does not match a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
   *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
   *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
   *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
   *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
   *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
   *    account.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user

  /**
   * @ngdoc input
   * @name input[range]
   *
   * @description
   * Native range input with validation and transformation.
   *
   * <div class="alert alert-warning">
   *   <p>
   *     In v1.5.9+, in order to avoid interfering with already existing, custom directives for
   *     `input[range]`, you need to let Angular know that you want to enable its built-in support.
   *     You can do this by adding the `ng-input-range` attribute to the input element. E.g.:
   *     `<input type="range" ng-input-range ... />`
   *   </p><br />
   *   <p>
   *     Input elements without the `ng-input-range` attibute will continue to be treated the same
   *     as in previous versions (e.g. their model value will be a string not a number and Angular
   *     will not take `min`/`max`/`step` attributes and properties into account).
   *   </p><br />
   *   <p>
   *     **Note:** From v1.6.x onwards, the support for `input[range]` will be always enabled and
   *     the `ng-input-range` attribute will have no effect.
   *   </p><br />
   *   <p>
   *     This documentation page refers to elements which have the built-in support enabled; i.e.
   *     elements _with_ the `ng-input-range` attribute.
   *   </p>
   * </div>
   *
   * The model for the range input must always be a `Number`.
   *
   * IE9 and other browsers that do not support the `range` type fall back
   * to a text input without any default values for `min`, `max` and `step`. Model binding,
   * validation and number parsing are nevertheless supported.
   *
   * Browsers that support range (latest Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge) treat `input[range]`
   * in a way that never allows the input to hold an invalid value. That means:
   * - any non-numerical value is set to `(max + min) / 2`.
   * - any numerical value that is less than the current min val, or greater than the current max val
   * is set to the min / max val respectively.
   * - additionally, the current `step` is respected, so the nearest value that satisfies a step
   * is used.
   *
   * See the [HTML Spec on input[type=range]](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/forms.html#range-state-(type=range))
   * for more info.
   *
   * This has the following consequences for Angular:
   *
   * Since the element value should always reflect the current model value, a range input
   * will set the bound ngModel expression to the value that the browser has set for the
   * input element. For example, in the following input `<input type="range" ng-input-range ng-model="model.value">`,
   * if the application sets `model.value = null`, the browser will set the input to `'50'`.
   * Angular will then set the model to `50`, to prevent input and model value being out of sync.
   *
   * That means the model for range will immediately be set to `50` after `ngModel` has been
   * initialized. It also means a range input can never have the required error.
   *
   * This does not only affect changes to the model value, but also to the values of the `min`,
   * `max`, and `step` attributes. When these change in a way that will cause the browser to modify
   * the input value, Angular will also update the model value.
   *
   * Automatic value adjustment also means that a range input element can never have the `required`,
   * `min`, or `max` errors.
   *
   * However, `step` is currently only fully implemented by Firefox. Other browsers have problems
   * when the step value changes dynamically - they do not adjust the element value correctly, but
   * instead may set the `stepMismatch` error. If that's the case, the Angular will set the `step`
   * error on the input, and set the model to `undefined`.
   *
   * Note that `input[range]` is not compatible with `ngMax`, `ngMin`, and `ngStep`, because they do
   * not set the `min` and `max` attributes, which means that the browser won't automatically adjust
   * the input value based on their values, and will always assume min = 0, max = 100, and step = 1.
   *
   * @param           ngInputRange The presense of this attribute enables the built-in support for
   *                  `input[range]`.
   * @param {string}  ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
   * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
   * @param {string=} min Sets the `min` validation to ensure that the value entered is greater
   *                  than `min`. Can be interpolated.
   * @param {string=} max Sets the `max` validation to ensure that the value entered is less than `max`.
   *                  Can be interpolated.
   * @param {string=} step Sets the `step` validation to ensure that the value entered matches the `step`
   *                  Can be interpolated.
   * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when the ngModel value changes due
   *                  to user interaction with the input element.
   * @param {expression=} ngChecked If the expression is truthy, then the `checked` attribute will be set on the
   *                      element. **Note** : `ngChecked` should not be used alongside `ngModel`.
   *                      Checkout {@link ng.directive:ngChecked ngChecked} for usage.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive

 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * HTML textarea element control with angular data-binding. The data-binding and validation
 * properties of this element are exactly the same as those of the
 * {@link ng.directive:input input element}.
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
 *    minlength.
 * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
 *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of any
 *    length.
 * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue $viewValue}
 *    does not match a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
 *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
 *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
 *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
 *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
 *    account.
 * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
 *    interaction with the input element.
 * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.

 * insert the placeholder value as the textarea's content. If the placeholder value contains
 * interpolation (`{{ ... }}`), an error will be logged in the console when Angular tries to update
 * the value of the by-then-removed text node. This doesn't affect the functionality of the
 * textarea, but can be undesirable.
 *
 * You can work around this Internet Explorer issue by using `ng-attr-placeholder` instead of
 * `placeholder` on textareas, whenever you need interpolation in the placeholder value. You can
 * find more details on `ngAttr` in the
 * [Interpolation](guide/interpolation#-ngattr-for-binding-to-arbitrary-attributes) section of the
 * Developer Guide.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name input
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * HTML input element control. When used together with {@link ngModel `ngModel`}, it provides data-binding,
 * input state control, and validation.
 * Input control follows HTML5 input types and polyfills the HTML5 validation behavior for older browsers.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** Not every feature offered is available for all input types.
 * Specifically, data binding and event handling via `ng-model` is unsupported for `input[file]`.
 * </div>
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
 * @param {boolean=} ngRequired Sets `required` attribute if set to true
 * @param {number=} ngMinlength Sets `minlength` validation error key if the value is shorter than
 *    minlength.
 * @param {number=} ngMaxlength Sets `maxlength` validation error key if the value is longer than
 *    maxlength. Setting the attribute to a negative or non-numeric value, allows view values of any
 *    length.
 * @param {string=} ngPattern Sets `pattern` validation error key if the ngModel {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue $viewValue}
 *    value does not match a RegExp found by evaluating the Angular expression given in the attribute value.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
 *    If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp
 *    after wrapping it in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to
 *    `new RegExp('^abc$')`.<br />
 *    **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
 *    start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
 *    account.
 * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when input changes due to user
 *    interaction with the input element.
 * @param {boolean=} [ngTrim=true] If set to false Angular will not automatically trim the input.
 *    This parameter is ignored for input[type=password] controls, which will never trim the
 *    input.

 * The `ngBind` attribute tells Angular to replace the text content of the specified HTML element

 *
 * Typically, you don't use `ngBind` directly, but instead you use the double curly markup like
 * `{{ expression }}` which is similar but less verbose.
 *
 * It is preferable to use `ngBind` instead of `{{ expression }}` if a template is momentarily
 * displayed by the browser in its raw state before Angular compiles it. Since `ngBind` is an
 * element attribute, it makes the bindings invisible to the user while the page is loading.
 *
 * An alternative solution to this problem would be using the

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngClass
 * @restrict AC
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngClass` directive allows you to dynamically set CSS classes on an HTML element by databinding
 * an expression that represents all classes to be added.
 *
 * The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression
 * evaluates to:
 *
 * 1. If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class
 * names.
 *
 * 2. If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the
 * object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
 *
 * 3. If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should either be a string as in
 * type 1 or an object as in type 2. This means that you can mix strings and objects together in an array
 * to give you more control over what CSS classes appear. See the code below for an example of this.
 *
 *
 * The directive won't add duplicate classes if a particular class was already set.
 *
 * When the expression changes, the previously added classes are removed and only then are the
 * new classes added.
 *
 * @knownIssue
 * You should not use {@link guide/interpolation interpolation} in the value of the `class`
 * attribute, when using the `ngClass` directive on the same element.
 * See {@link guide/interpolation#known-issues here} for more info.
 *
 * @animations
 * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |
 * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.$animate#addClass addClass}       | just before the class is applied to the element   |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#removeClass removeClass} | just before the class is removed from the element |
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngClass {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval. The result
 *   of the evaluation can be a string representing space delimited class
 *   names, an array, or a map of class names to boolean values. In the case of a map, the
 *   names of the properties whose values are truthy will be added as css classes to the
 *   element.
 *
 * @example Example that demonstrates basic bindings via ngClass directive.

      <br>
      <span class="base-class" ng-class="myVar">Sample Text</span>
     </file>
     <file name="style.css">
       .base-class {
         transition:all cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940) 0.5s;
       }

       .base-class.my-class {
         color: red;
         font-size:3em;
       }
     </file>
     <file name="protractor.js" type="protractor">
       it('should check ng-class', function() {
         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('setbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).
           toMatch(/my-class/);

         element(by.id('clearbtn')).click();

         expect(element(by.css('.base-class')).getAttribute('class')).not.
           toMatch(/my-class/);
       });
     </file>
   </example>


   ## ngClass and pre-existing CSS3 Transitions/Animations
   The ngClass directive still supports CSS3 Transitions/Animations even if they do not follow the ngAnimate CSS naming structure.
   Upon animation ngAnimate will apply supplementary CSS classes to track the start and end of an animation, but this will not hinder
   any pre-existing CSS transitions already on the element. To get an idea of what happens during a class-based animation, be sure
   to view the step by step details of {@link $animate#addClass $animate.addClass} and
   {@link $animate#removeClass $animate.removeClass}.

 * The `ngCloak` directive is used to prevent the Angular html template from being briefly
 * displayed by the browser in its raw (uncompiled) form while your application is loading. Use this
 * directive to avoid the undesirable flicker effect caused by the html template display.
 *
 * The directive can be applied to the `<body>` element, but the preferred usage is to apply
 * multiple `ngCloak` directives to small portions of the page to permit progressive rendering
 * of the browser view.
 *
 * `ngCloak` works in cooperation with the following css rule embedded within `angular.js` and
 * `angular.min.js`.
 * For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your html file (see {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```css
 * [ng\:cloak], [ng-cloak], [data-ng-cloak], [x-ng-cloak], .ng-cloak, .x-ng-cloak {
 *   display: none !important;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * When this css rule is loaded by the browser, all html elements (including their children) that
 * are tagged with the `ngCloak` directive are hidden. When Angular encounters this directive
 * during the compilation of the template it deletes the `ngCloak` element attribute, making
 * the compiled element visible.
 *
 * For the best result, the `angular.js` script must be loaded in the head section of the html
 * document; alternatively, the css rule above must be included in the external stylesheet of the
 * application.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngController
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngController` directive attaches a controller class to the view. This is a key aspect of how angular
 * supports the principles behind the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
 *
 * MVC components in angular:
 *
 * * Model — Models are the properties of a scope; scopes are attached to the DOM where scope properties
 *   are accessed through bindings.
 * * View — The template (HTML with data bindings) that is rendered into the View.
 * * Controller — The `ngController` directive specifies a Controller class; the class contains business
 *   logic behind the application to decorate the scope with functions and values
 *
 * Note that you can also attach controllers to the DOM by declaring it in a route definition
 * via the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service. A common mistake is to declare the controller
 * again using `ng-controller` in the template itself.  This will cause the controller to be attached
 * and executed twice.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 500
 * @param {expression} ngController Name of a constructor function registered with the current
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider $controllerProvider} or an {@link guide/expression expression}
 * that on the current scope evaluates to a constructor function.
 *
 * The controller instance can be published into a scope property by specifying
 * `ng-controller="as propertyName"`.
 *
 * If the current `$controllerProvider` is configured to use globals (via
 * {@link ng.$controllerProvider#allowGlobals `$controllerProvider.allowGlobals()` }), this may
 * also be the name of a globally accessible constructor function (not recommended).
 *
 * @example
 * Here is a simple form for editing user contact information. Adding, removing, clearing, and
 * greeting are methods declared on the controller (see source tab). These methods can
 * easily be called from the angular markup. Any changes to the data are automatically reflected
 * in the View without the need for a manual update.
 *
 * Two different declaration styles are included below:
 *
 * * one binds methods and properties directly onto the controller using `this`:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController1 as settings"`
 * * one injects `$scope` into the controller:
 * `ng-controller="SettingsController2"`
 *
 * The second option is more common in the Angular community, and is generally used in boilerplates
 * and in this guide. However, there are advantages to binding properties directly to the controller
 * and avoiding scope.
 *
 * * Using `controller as` makes it obvious which controller you are accessing in the template when
 * multiple controllers apply to an element.
 * * If you are writing your controllers as classes you have easier access to the properties and
 * methods, which will appear on the scope, from inside the controller code.
 * * Since there is always a `.` in the bindings, you don't have to worry about prototypal
 * inheritance masking primitives.
 *
 * This example demonstrates the `controller as` syntax.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngCsp
 *
 * @restrict A
 * @element ANY
 * @description
 *
 * Angular has some features that can conflict with certain restrictions that are applied when using
 * [CSP (Content Security Policy)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Security/CSP) rules.
 *
 * If you intend to implement CSP with these rules then you must tell Angular not to use these
 * features.
 *
 * This is necessary when developing things like Google Chrome Extensions or Universal Windows Apps.
 *
 *
 * The following default rules in CSP affect Angular:
 *
 * * The use of `eval()`, `Function(string)` and similar functions to dynamically create and execute
 * code from strings is forbidden. Angular makes use of this in the {@link $parse} service to
 * provide a 30% increase in the speed of evaluating Angular expressions. (This CSP rule can be
 * disabled with the CSP keyword `unsafe-eval`, but it is generally not recommended as it would
 * weaken the protections offered by CSP.)
 *
 * * The use of inline resources, such as inline `<script>` and `<style>` elements, are forbidden.
 * This prevents apps from injecting custom styles directly into the document. Angular makes use of
 * this to include some CSS rules (e.g. {@link ngCloak} and {@link ngHide}). To make these
 * directives work when a CSP rule is blocking inline styles, you must link to the `angular-csp.css`
 * in your HTML manually. (This CSP rule can be disabled with the CSP keyword `unsafe-inline`, but
 * it is generally not recommended as it would weaken the protections offered by CSP.)
 *
 * If you do not provide `ngCsp` then Angular tries to autodetect if CSP is blocking dynamic code
 * creation from strings (e.g., `unsafe-eval` not specified in CSP header) and automatically
 * deactivates this feature in the {@link $parse} service. This autodetection, however, triggers a
 * CSP error to be logged in the console:
 *
 * ```
 * Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because 'unsafe-eval' is not an allowed source of
 * script in the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'self'". Note that
 * 'script-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.
 * ```
 *
 * This error is harmless but annoying. To prevent the error from showing up, put the `ngCsp`
 * directive on an element of the HTML document that appears before the `<script>` tag that loads
 * the `angular.js` file.
 *
 * *Note: This directive is only available in the `ng-csp` and `data-ng-csp` attribute form.*
 *
 * You can specify which of the CSP related Angular features should be deactivated by providing
 * a value for the `ng-csp` attribute. The options are as follows:
 *
 * * no-inline-style: this stops Angular from injecting CSS styles into the DOM
 *
 * * no-unsafe-eval: this stops Angular from optimizing $parse with unsafe eval of strings
 *
 * You can use these values in the following combinations:
 *
 *
 * * No declaration means that Angular will assume that you can do inline styles, but it will do
 * a runtime check for unsafe-eval. E.g. `<body>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous
 * versions of Angular.
 *
 * * A simple `ng-csp` (or `data-ng-csp`) attribute will tell Angular to deactivate both inline
 * styles and unsafe eval. E.g. `<body ng-csp>`. This is backwardly compatible with previous
 * versions of Angular.
 *
 * * Specifying only `no-unsafe-eval` tells Angular that we must not use eval, but that we can
 * inject inline styles. E.g. `<body ng-csp="no-unsafe-eval">`.
 *
 * * Specifying only `no-inline-style` tells Angular that we must not inject styles, but that we can
 * run eval - no automatic check for unsafe eval will occur. E.g. `<body ng-csp="no-inline-style">`
 *
 * * Specifying both `no-unsafe-eval` and `no-inline-style` tells Angular that we must not inject
 * styles nor use eval, which is the same as an empty: ng-csp.
 * E.g.`<body ng-csp="no-inline-style;no-unsafe-eval">`
 *
 * @example
 * This example shows how to apply the `ngCsp` directive to the `html` tag.
   ```html
     <!doctype html>
     <html ng-app ng-csp>
     ...
     ...
     </html>
   ```

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngIf
 * @restrict A
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngIf` directive removes or recreates a portion of the DOM tree based on an
 * {expression}. If the expression assigned to `ngIf` evaluates to a false
 * value then the element is removed from the DOM, otherwise a clone of the
 * element is reinserted into the DOM.
 *
 * `ngIf` differs from `ngShow` and `ngHide` in that `ngIf` completely removes and recreates the
 * element in the DOM rather than changing its visibility via the `display` css property.  A common
 * case when this difference is significant is when using css selectors that rely on an element's
 * position within the DOM, such as the `:first-child` or `:last-child` pseudo-classes.
 *
 * Note that when an element is removed using `ngIf` its scope is destroyed and a new scope
 * is created when the element is restored.  The scope created within `ngIf` inherits from
 * its parent scope using
 * [prototypal inheritance](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes#javascript-prototypal-inheritance).
 * An important implication of this is if `ngModel` is used within `ngIf` to bind to
 * a javascript primitive defined in the parent scope. In this case any modifications made to the
 * variable within the child scope will override (hide) the value in the parent scope.
 *
 * Also, `ngIf` recreates elements using their compiled state. An example of this behavior
 * is if an element's class attribute is directly modified after it's compiled, using something like
 * jQuery's `.addClass()` method, and the element is later removed. When `ngIf` recreates the element
 * the added class will be lost because the original compiled state is used to regenerate the element.
 *
 * Additionally, you can provide animations via the `ngAnimate` module to animate the `enter`
 * and `leave` effects.
 *
 * @animations
 * | Animation                        | Occurs                               |
 * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter}  | just after the `ngIf` contents change and a new DOM element is created and injected into the `ngIf` container |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave}  | just before the `ngIf` contents are removed from the DOM |
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 600
 * @param {expression} ngIf If the {@link guide/expression expression} is falsy then
 *     the element is removed from the DOM tree. If it is truthy a copy of the compiled
 *     element is added to the DOM tree.
 *

 * The `ngInit` directive allows you to evaluate an expression in the

 *
 * <div class="alert alert-danger">
 * This directive can be abused to add unnecessary amounts of logic into your templates.
 * There are only a few appropriate uses of `ngInit`, such as for aliasing special properties of
 * {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat `ngRepeat`}, as seen in the demo below; and for injecting data via
 * server side scripting. Besides these few cases, you should use {@link guide/controller controllers}
 * rather than `ngInit` to initialize values on a scope.
 * </div>
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note**: If you have assignment in `ngInit` along with a {@link ng.$filter `filter`}, make
 * sure you have parentheses to ensure correct operator precedence:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * `<div ng-init="test1 = ($index | toString)"></div>`
 * </pre>
 * </div>
 *
 * @priority 450
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @param {expression} ngInit {@link guide/expression Expression} to eval.
 *

   <script>
     angular.module('initExample', [])

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngList
 *
 * @description
 * Text input that converts between a delimited string and an array of strings. The default
 * delimiter is a comma followed by a space - equivalent to `ng-list=", "`. You can specify a custom
 * delimiter as the value of the `ngList` attribute - for example, `ng-list=" | "`.
 *
 * The behaviour of the directive is affected by the use of the `ngTrim` attribute.
 * * If `ngTrim` is set to `"false"` then whitespace around both the separator and each
 *   list item is respected. This implies that the user of the directive is responsible for
 *   dealing with whitespace but also allows you to use whitespace as a delimiter, such as a
 *   tab or newline character.
 * * Otherwise whitespace around the delimiter is ignored when splitting (although it is respected
 *   when joining the list items back together) and whitespace around each list item is stripped
 *   before it is added to the model.

Parsers are used to sanitize / convert the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue

Returning `undefined` from a parser means a parse error occurred. In that case,

is set to `true`. The parse error is stored in `ngModel.$error.parse`.

 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $validators A collection of validators that are applied
 *      whenever the model value changes. The key value within the object refers to the name of the

 *      provided with the model value as an argument and must return a true or false value depending
 *      on the response of that validation.
 *
 * ```js

 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *   return /[0-9]+/.test(value) &&
 *          /[a-z]+/.test(value) &&

 *
 * @property {Object.<string, function>} $asyncValidators A collection of validations that are expected to
 *      perform an asynchronous validation (e.g. a HTTP request). The validation function that is provided
 *      is expected to return a promise when it is run during the model validation process. Once the promise
 *      is delivered then the validation status will be set to true when fulfilled and false when rejected.
 *      When the asynchronous validators are triggered, each of the validators will run in parallel and the model
 *      value will only be updated once all validators have been fulfilled. As long as an asynchronous validator
 *      is unfulfilled, its key will be added to the controllers `$pending` property. Also, all asynchronous validators
 *      will only run once all synchronous validators have passed.
 *
 * Please note that if $http is used then it is important that the server returns a success HTTP response code
 * in order to fulfill the validation and a status level of `4xx` in order to reject the validation.
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModel.$asyncValidators.uniqueUsername = function(modelValue, viewValue) {
 *   var value = modelValue || viewValue;
 *
 *   // Lookup user by username

 * ```
 *
 * @property {Array.<Function>} $viewChangeListeners Array of functions to execute whenever the
 *     view value has changed. It is called with no arguments, and its return value is ignored.
 *     This can be used in place of additional $watches against the model value.
 *
 * @property {Object} $error An object hash with all failing validator ids as keys.
 * @property {Object} $pending An object hash with all pending validator ids as keys.
 *

 * @description
 *
 * `NgModelController` provides API for the {@link ngModel `ngModel`} directive.
 * The controller contains services for data-binding, validation, CSS updates, and value formatting
 * and parsing. It purposefully does not contain any logic which deals with DOM rendering or
 * listening to DOM events.
 * Such DOM related logic should be provided by other directives which make use of
 * `NgModelController` for data-binding to control elements.
 * Angular provides this DOM logic for most {@link input `input`} elements.
 * At the end of this page you can find a {@link ngModel.NgModelController#custom-control-example
 * custom control example} that uses `ngModelController` to bind to `contenteditable` elements.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Custom Control Example
 * This example shows how to use `NgModelController` with a custom control to achieve
 * data-binding. Notice how different directives (`contenteditable`, `ng-model`, and `required`)
 * collaborate together to achieve the desired result.
 *
 * `contenteditable` is an HTML5 attribute, which tells the browser to let the element
 * contents be edited in place by the user.
 *
 * We are using the {@link ng.service:$sce $sce} service here and include the {@link ngSanitize $sanitize}
 * module to automatically remove "bad" content like inline event listener (e.g. `<span onclick="...">`).
 * However, as we are using `$sce` the model can still decide to provide unsafe content if it marks
 * that content using the `$sce` service.
 *
 * <example name="NgModelController" module="customControl" deps="angular-sanitize.js">
    <file name="style.css">
      [contenteditable] {
        border: 1px solid black;
        background-color: white;
        min-height: 20px;
      }

      .ng-invalid {

   *
   * If you have an input that uses `ng-model-options` to set up debounced updates or updates that
   * depend on special events such as `blur`, there can be a period when the `$viewValue` is out of
   * sync with the ngModel's `$modelValue`.
   *
   * In this case, you can use `$rollbackViewValue()` to manually cancel the debounced / future update
   * and reset the input to the last committed view value.
   *
   * It is also possible that you run into difficulties if you try to update the ngModel's `$modelValue`
   * programmatically before these debounced/future events have resolved/occurred, because Angular's
   * dirty checking mechanism is not able to tell whether the model has actually changed or not.
   *
   * The `$rollbackViewValue()` method should be called before programmatically changing the model of an
   * input which may have such events pending. This is important in order to make sure that the
   * input field will be updated with the new model value and any pending operations are cancelled.

   * @ngdoc method

   *
   * @description
   * Update the view value.
   *
   * This method should be called when a control wants to change the view value; typically,
   * this is done from within a DOM event handler. For example, the {@link ng.directive:input input}
   * directive calls it when the value of the input changes and {@link ng.directive:select select}
   * calls it when an option is selected.
   *
   * When `$setViewValue` is called, the new `value` will be staged for committing through the `$parsers`
   * and `$validators` pipelines. If there are no special {@link ngModelOptions} specified then the staged
   * value sent directly for processing, finally to be applied to `$modelValue` and then the
   * **expression** specified in the `ng-model` attribute. Lastly, all the registered change listeners,
   * in the `$viewChangeListeners` list, are called.
   *
   * In case the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions} directive is used with `updateOn`
   * and the `default` trigger is not listed, all those actions will remain pending until one of the
   * `updateOn` events is triggered on the DOM element.
   * All these actions will be debounced if the {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions ngModelOptions}
   * directive is used with a custom debounce for this particular event.
   * Note that a `$digest` is only triggered once the `updateOn` events are fired, or if `debounce`
   * is specified, once the timer runs out.
   *
   * When used with standard inputs, the view value will always be a string (which is in some cases
   * parsed into another type, such as a `Date` object for `input[date]`.)
   * However, custom controls might also pass objects to this method. In this case, we should make
   * a copy of the object before passing it to `$setViewValue`. This is because `ngModel` does not
   * perform a deep watch of objects, it only looks for a change of identity. If you only change
   * the property of the object then ngModel will not realize that the object has changed and
   * will not invoke the `$parsers` and `$validators` pipelines. For this reason, you should
   * not change properties of the copy once it has been passed to `$setViewValue`.
   * Otherwise you may cause the model value on the scope to change incorrectly.
   *
   * <div class="alert alert-info">
   * In any case, the value passed to the method should always reflect the current value
   * of the control. For example, if you are calling `$setViewValue` for an input element,
   * you should pass the input DOM value. Otherwise, the control and the scope model become
   * out of sync. It's also important to note that `$setViewValue` does not call `$render` or change
   * the control's DOM value in any way. If we want to change the control's DOM value
   * programmatically, we should update the `ngModel` scope expression. Its new value will be
   * picked up by the model controller, which will run it through the `$formatters`, `$render` it
   * to update the DOM, and finally call `$validate` on it.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModel
 *
 * @element input
 * @priority 1
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngModel` directive binds an `input`,`select`, `textarea` (or custom form control) to a
 * property on the scope using {@link ngModel.NgModelController NgModelController},
 * which is created and exposed by this directive.
 *
 * `ngModel` is responsible for:
 *
 * - Binding the view into the model, which other directives such as `input`, `textarea` or `select`
 *   require.
 * - Providing validation behavior (i.e. required, number, email, url).
 * - Keeping the state of the control (valid/invalid, dirty/pristine, touched/untouched, validation errors).
 * - Setting related css classes on the element (`ng-valid`, `ng-invalid`, `ng-dirty`, `ng-pristine`, `ng-touched`,
 *   `ng-untouched`, `ng-empty`, `ng-not-empty`) including animations.
 * - Registering the control with its parent {@link ng.directive:form form}.
 *
 * Note: `ngModel` will try to bind to the property given by evaluating the expression on the
 * current scope. If the property doesn't already exist on this scope, it will be created
 * implicitly and added to the scope.
 *
 * For best practices on using `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - [Understanding Scopes](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/wiki/Understanding-Scopes)
 *
 * For basic examples, how to use `ngModel`, see:
 *
 *  - {@link ng.directive:input input}
 *    - {@link input[text] text}
 *    - {@link input[checkbox] checkbox}
 *    - {@link input[radio] radio}
 *    - {@link input[number] number}
 *    - {@link input[email] email}
 *    - {@link input[url] url}
 *    - {@link input[date] date}
 *    - {@link input[datetime-local] datetime-local}
 *    - {@link input[time] time}
 *    - {@link input[month] month}
 *    - {@link input[week] week}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:select select}
 *  - {@link ng.directive:textarea textarea}
 *
 * # Complex Models (objects or collections)
 *
 * By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important to know when
 * binding inputs to models that are objects (e.g. `Date`) or collections (e.g. arrays). If only properties of the
 * object or collection change, `ngModel` will not be notified and so the input will not be  re-rendered.
 *
 * The model must be assigned an entirely new object or collection before a re-rendering will occur.
 *
 * Some directives have options that will cause them to use a custom `$watchCollection` on the model expression
 * - for example, `ngOptions` will do so when a `track by` clause is included in the comprehension expression or
 * if the select is given the `multiple` attribute.
 *
 * The `$watchCollection()` method only does a shallow comparison, meaning that changing properties deeper than the
 * first level of the object (or only changing the properties of an item in the collection if it's an array) will still
 * not trigger a re-rendering of the model.
 *
 * # CSS classes
 * The following CSS classes are added and removed on the associated input/select/textarea element
 * depending on the validity of the model.
 *
 *  - `ng-valid`: the model is valid
 *  - `ng-invalid`: the model is invalid
 *  - `ng-valid-[key]`: for each valid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-invalid-[key]`: for each invalid key added by `$setValidity`
 *  - `ng-pristine`: the control hasn't been interacted with yet
 *  - `ng-dirty`: the control has been interacted with
 *  - `ng-touched`: the control has been blurred
 *  - `ng-untouched`: the control hasn't been blurred
 *  - `ng-pending`: any `$asyncValidators` are unfulfilled
 *  - `ng-empty`: the view does not contain a value or the value is deemed "empty", as defined
 *     by the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$isEmpty} method
 *  - `ng-not-empty`: the view contains a non-empty value
 *
 * Keep in mind that ngAnimate can detect each of these classes when added and removed.
 *
 * ## Animation Hooks
 *
 * Animations within models are triggered when any of the associated CSS classes are added and removed
 * on the input element which is attached to the model. These classes include: `.ng-pristine`, `.ng-dirty`,
 * `.ng-invalid` and `.ng-valid` as well as any other validations that are performed on the model itself.
 * The animations that are triggered within ngModel are similar to how they work in ngClass and
 * animations can be hooked into using CSS transitions, keyframes as well as JS animations.
 *
 * The following example shows a simple way to utilize CSS transitions to style an input element
 * that has been rendered as invalid after it has been validated:
 *
 * <pre>
 * //be sure to include ngAnimate as a module to hook into more
 * //advanced animations
 * .my-input {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   background: white;
 * }
 * .my-input.ng-invalid {
 *   background: red;
 *   color:white;
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * @example
 * <example deps="angular-animate.js" animations="true" fixBase="true" module="inputExample" name="ng-model">
     <file name="index.html">
       <script>
        angular.module('inputExample', [])
          .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
            $scope.val = '1';
          }]);
       </script>
       <style>
         .my-input {
           transition:all linear 0.5s;
           background: transparent;
         }
         .my-input.ng-invalid {
           color:white;
           background: red;
         }
       </style>
       <p id="inputDescription">
        Update input to see transitions when valid/invalid.
        Integer is a valid value.
       </p>
       <form name="testForm" ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <input ng-model="val" ng-pattern="/^\d+$/" name="anim" class="my-input"
                aria-describedby="inputDescription" />
       </form>
     </file>
 * </example>
 *
 * ## Binding to a getter/setter
 *
 * Sometimes it's helpful to bind `ngModel` to a getter/setter function.  A getter/setter is a
 * function that returns a representation of the model when called with zero arguments, and sets
 * the internal state of a model when called with an argument. It's sometimes useful to use this
 * for models that have an internal representation that's different from what the model exposes
 * to the view.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * **Best Practice:** It's best to keep getters fast because Angular is likely to call them more
 * frequently than other parts of your code.
 * </div>
 *
 * You use this behavior by adding `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to an element that
 * has `ng-model` attached to it. You can also add `ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }"` to
 * a `<form>`, which will enable this behavior for all `<input>`s within it. See
 * {@link ng.directive:ngModelOptions `ngModelOptions`} for more.
 *
 * The following example shows how to use `ngModel` with a getter/setter:
 *
 * @example
 * <example name="ngModel-getter-setter" module="getterSetterExample">
     <file name="index.html">
       <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
         <form name="userForm">
           <label>Name:
             <input type="text" name="userName"
                    ng-model="user.name"
                    ng-model-options="{ getterSetter: true }" />
           </label>
         </form>
         <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name()"></span></pre>
       </div>
     </file>
     <file name="app.js">
       angular.module('getterSetterExample', [])
         .controller('ExampleController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
           var _name = 'Brian';
           $scope.user = {
             name: function(newName) {
              // Note that newName can be undefined for two reasons:
              // 1. Because it is called as a getter and thus called with no arguments
              // 2. Because the property should actually be set to undefined. This happens e.g. if the
              //    input is invalid
              return arguments.length ? (_name = newName) : _name;
             }

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngModelOptions
 *
 * @description
 * Allows tuning how model updates are done. Using `ngModelOptions` you can specify a custom list of
 * events that will trigger a model update and/or a debouncing delay so that the actual update only
 * takes place when a timer expires; this timer will be reset after another change takes place.
 *
 * Given the nature of `ngModelOptions`, the value displayed inside input fields in the view might
 * be different from the value in the actual model. This means that if you update the model you
 * should also invoke {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`} on the relevant input field in
 * order to make sure it is synchronized with the model and that any debounced action is canceled.
 *
 * The easiest way to reference the control's {@link ngModel.NgModelController `$rollbackViewValue`}
 * method is by making sure the input is placed inside a form that has a `name` attribute. This is
 * important because `form` controllers are published to the related scope under the name in their
 * `name` attribute.
 *
 * Any pending changes will take place immediately when an enclosing form is submitted via the
 * `submit` event. Note that `ngClick` events will occur before the model is updated. Use `ngSubmit`
 * to have access to the updated model.
 *
 * `ngModelOptions` has an effect on the element it's declared on and its descendants.
 *
 * @param {Object} ngModelOptions options to apply to the current model. Valid keys are:
 *   - `updateOn`: string specifying which event should the input be bound to. You can set several
 *     events using an space delimited list. There is a special event called `default` that
 *     matches the default events belonging of the control.
 *   - `debounce`: integer value which contains the debounce model update value in milliseconds. A
 *     value of 0 triggers an immediate update. If an object is supplied instead, you can specify a
 *     custom value for each event. For example:
 *     `ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'default blur', debounce: { 'default': 500, 'blur': 0 } }"`
 *   - `allowInvalid`: boolean value which indicates that the model can be set with values that did
 *     not validate correctly instead of the default behavior of setting the model to undefined.
 *   - `getterSetter`: boolean value which determines whether or not to treat functions bound to
       `ngModel` as getters/setters.
 *   - `timezone`: Defines the timezone to be used to read/write the `Date` instance in the model for
 *     `<input type="date">`, `<input type="time">`, ... . It understands UTC/GMT and the
 *     continental US time zone abbreviations, but for general use, use a time zone offset, for
 *     example, `'+0430'` (4 hours, 30 minutes east of the Greenwich meridian)
 *     If not specified, the timezone of the browser will be used.
 *
 * @example

  The following example shows how to override immediate updates. Changes on the inputs within the
  form will update the model only when the control loses focus (blur event). If `escape` key is
  pressed while the input field is focused, the value is reset to the value in the current model.

  <example name="ngModelOptions-directive-blur" module="optionsExample">
    <file name="index.html">
      <div ng-controller="ExampleController">
        <form name="userForm">

            <input type="text" name="userName"
                   ng-model="user.name"
                   ng-model-options="{ updateOn: 'blur' }"
                   ng-keyup="cancel($event)" />
          </label><br />
          <label>Other data:
            <input type="text" ng-model="user.data" />
          </label><br />
        </form>
        <pre>user.name = <span ng-bind="user.name"></span></pre>

            if (e.keyCode === 27) {
              $scope.userForm.userName.$rollbackViewValue();

  This one shows how to debounce model changes. Model will be updated only 1 sec after last change.
  If the `Clear` button is pressed, any debounced action is canceled and the value becomes empty.

 * The `ngNonBindable` directive tells Angular not to compile or bind the contents of the current

 * bindings but which should be ignored by Angular. This could be the case if you have a site that
 * displays snippets of code, for instance.
 *
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @example
 * In this example there are two locations where a simple interpolation binding (`{{}}`) is present,
 * but the one wrapped in `ngNonBindable` is left alone.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngOptions
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngOptions` attribute can be used to dynamically generate a list of `<option>`
 * elements for the `<select>` element using the array or object obtained by evaluating the
 * `ngOptions` comprehension expression.
 *
 * In many cases, {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat ngRepeat} can be used on `<option>` elements
 * instead of `ngOptions` to achieve a similar result.
 * However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits such as reducing memory and
 * increasing speed by not creating a new scope for each repeated instance, as well as providing
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression. `ngOptions` should be used when the `<select>` model needs to be bound
 *  to a non-string value. This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at
 * present.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the array element or object property
 * represented by the selected option will be bound to the model identified by the `ngModel`
 * directive.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * ## Complex Models (objects or collections)
 *
 * By default, `ngModel` watches the model by reference, not value. This is important to know when
 * binding the select to a model that is an object or a collection.
 *
 * One issue occurs if you want to preselect an option. For example, if you set
 * the model to an object that is equal to an object in your collection, `ngOptions` won't be able to set the selection,
 * because the objects are not identical. So by default, you should always reference the item in your collection
 * for preselections, e.g.: `$scope.selected = $scope.collection[3]`.
 *
 * Another solution is to use a `track by` clause, because then `ngOptions` will track the identity
 * of the item not by reference, but by the result of the `track by` expression. For example, if your
 * collection items have an id property, you would `track by item.id`.
 *
 * A different issue with objects or collections is that ngModel won't detect if an object property or
 * a collection item changes. For that reason, `ngOptions` additionally watches the model using
 * `$watchCollection`, when the expression contains a `track by` clause or the the select has the `multiple` attribute.
 * This allows ngOptions to trigger a re-rendering of the options even if the actual object/collection
 * has not changed identity, but only a property on the object or an item in the collection changes.
 *
 * Note that `$watchCollection` does a shallow comparison of the properties of the object (or the items in the collection
 * if the model is an array). This means that changing a property deeper than the first level inside the
 * object/collection will not trigger a re-rendering.
 *
 * ## `select` **`as`**
 *
 * Using `select` **`as`** will bind the result of the `select` expression to the model, but
 * the value of the `<select>` and `<option>` html elements will be either the index (for array data sources)
 * or property name (for object data sources) of the value within the collection. If a **`track by`** expression
 * is used, the result of that expression will be set as the value of the `option` and `select` elements.
 *
 *
 * ### `select` **`as`** and **`track by`**
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Be careful when using `select` **`as`** and **`track by`** in the same expression.
 * </div>
 *
 * Given this array of items on the $scope:
 *
 * ```js
 * $scope.items = [{
 *   id: 1,
 *   label: 'aLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'aSubItem' }
 * }, {
 *   id: 2,
 *   label: 'bLabel',
 *   subItem: { name: 'bSubItem' }
 * }];
 * ```
 *
 * This will work:
 *
 * ```html
 * <select ng-options="item as item.label for item in items track by item.id" ng-model="selected"></select>
 * ```
 * ```js
 * $scope.selected = $scope.items[0];
 * ```
 *
 * but this will not work:
 *
 * ```html
 * <select ng-options="item.subItem as item.label for item in items track by item.id" ng-model="selected"></select>
 * ```
 * ```js
 * $scope.selected = $scope.items[0].subItem;
 * ```
 *
 * In both examples, the **`track by`** expression is applied successfully to each `item` in the
 * `items` array. Because the selected option has been set programmatically in the controller, the
 * **`track by`** expression is also applied to the `ngModel` value. In the first example, the
 * `ngModel` value is `items[0]` and the **`track by`** expression evaluates to `items[0].id` with
 * no issue. In the second example, the `ngModel` value is `items[0].subItem` and the **`track by`**
 * expression evaluates to `items[0].subItem.id` (which is undefined). As a result, the model value
 * is not matched against any `<option>` and the `<select>` appears as having no selected value.
 *
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} required The control is considered valid only if value is entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds `required` attribute and `required` validation constraint to
 *    the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use `ngRequired` instead of
 *    `required` when you want to data-bind to the `required` attribute.
 * @param {comprehension_expression=} ngOptions in one of the following forms:
 *
 *   * for array data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *     * `label` **`for`** `value` **`in`** `array` | orderBy:`orderexpr` **`track by`** `trackexpr`
 *        (for including a filter with `track by`)
 *   * for object data sources:
 *     * `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`for (`**`key` **`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`group by`** `group` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `label` **`disable when`** `disable` **`for (`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`group by`** `group`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *     * `select` **`as`** `label` **`disable when`** `disable`
 *         **`for` `(`**`key`**`,`** `value`**`) in`** `object`
 *
 * Where:
 *
 *   * `array` / `object`: an expression which evaluates to an array / object to iterate over.
 *   * `value`: local variable which will refer to each item in the `array` or each property value
 *      of `object` during iteration.
 *   * `key`: local variable which will refer to a property name in `object` during iteration.
 *   * `label`: The result of this expression will be the label for `<option>` element. The
 *     `expression` will most likely refer to the `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`).
 *   * `select`: The result of this expression will be bound to the model of the parent `<select>`
 *      element. If not specified, `select` expression will default to `value`.
 *   * `group`: The result of this expression will be used to group options using the `<optgroup>`
 *      DOM element.
 *   * `disable`: The result of this expression will be used to disable the rendered `<option>`
 *      element. Return `true` to disable.
 *   * `trackexpr`: Used when working with an array of objects. The result of this expression will be
 *      used to identify the objects in the array. The `trackexpr` will most likely refer to the
 *     `value` variable (e.g. `value.propertyName`). With this the selection is preserved
 *      even when the options are recreated (e.g. reloaded from the server).

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngPluralize
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * `ngPluralize` is a directive that displays messages according to en-US localization rules.
 * These rules are bundled with angular.js, but can be overridden
 * (see {@link guide/i18n Angular i18n} dev guide). You configure ngPluralize directive
 * by specifying the mappings between
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * and the strings to be displayed.
 *
 * # Plural categories and explicit number rules
 * There are two
 * [plural categories](http://unicode.org/repos/cldr-tmp/trunk/diff/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html)
 * in Angular's default en-US locale: "one" and "other".
 *
 * While a plural category may match many numbers (for example, in en-US locale, "other" can match
 * any number that is not 1), an explicit number rule can only match one number. For example, the
 * explicit number rule for "3" matches the number 3. There are examples of plural categories
 * and explicit number rules throughout the rest of this documentation.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize
 * You configure ngPluralize by providing 2 attributes: `count` and `when`.
 * You can also provide an optional attribute, `offset`.
 *
 * The value of the `count` attribute can be either a string or an {@link guide/expression
 * Angular expression}; these are evaluated on the current scope for its bound value.
 *
 * The `when` attribute specifies the mappings between plural categories and the actual
 * string to be displayed. The value of the attribute should be a JSON object.
 *
 * The following example shows how to configure ngPluralize:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount"
                 when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      'one': '1 person is viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{} people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 *```
 *
 * In the example, `"0: Nobody is viewing."` is an explicit number rule. If you did not
 * specify this rule, 0 would be matched to the "other" category and "0 people are viewing"
 * would be shown instead of "Nobody is viewing". You can specify an explicit number rule for
 * other numbers, for example 12, so that instead of showing "12 people are viewing", you can
 * show "a dozen people are viewing".
 *
 * You can use a set of closed braces (`{}`) as a placeholder for the number that you want substituted
 * into pluralized strings. In the previous example, Angular will replace `{}` with
 * <span ng-non-bindable>`{{personCount}}`</span>. The closed braces `{}` is a placeholder
 * for <span ng-non-bindable>{{numberExpression}}</span>.
 *
 * If no rule is defined for a category, then an empty string is displayed and a warning is generated.
 * Note that some locales define more categories than `one` and `other`. For example, fr-fr defines `few` and `many`.
 *
 * # Configuring ngPluralize with offset
 * The `offset` attribute allows further customization of pluralized text, which can result in
 * a better user experience. For example, instead of the message "4 people are viewing this document",
 * you might display "John, Kate and 2 others are viewing this document".
 * The offset attribute allows you to offset a number by any desired value.
 * Let's take a look at an example:
 *
 * ```html
 * <ng-pluralize count="personCount" offset=2
 *               when="{'0': 'Nobody is viewing.',
 *                      '1': '{{person1}} is viewing.',
 *                      '2': '{{person1}} and {{person2}} are viewing.',
 *                      'one': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and one other person are viewing.',
 *                      'other': '{{person1}}, {{person2}} and {} other people are viewing.'}">
 * </ng-pluralize>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice that we are still using two plural categories(one, other), but we added
 * three explicit number rules 0, 1 and 2.
 * When one person, perhaps John, views the document, "John is viewing" will be shown.
 * When three people view the document, no explicit number rule is found, so
 * an offset of 2 is taken off 3, and Angular uses 1 to decide the plural category.
 * In this case, plural category 'one' is matched and "John, Mary and one other person are viewing"
 * is shown.
 *
 * Note that when you specify offsets, you must provide explicit number rules for
 * numbers from 0 up to and including the offset. If you use an offset of 3, for example,
 * you must provide explicit number rules for 0, 1, 2 and 3. You must also provide plural strings for
 * plural categories "one" and "other".
 *
 * @param {string|expression} count The variable to be bound to.
 * @param {string} when The mapping between plural category to its corresponding strings.
 * @param {number=} offset Offset to deduct from the total number.
 *

 *
 * @description
 * The `ngRepeat` directive instantiates a template once per item from a collection. Each template
 * instance gets its own scope, where the given loop variable is set to the current collection item,
 * and `$index` is set to the item index or key.
 *
 * Special properties are exposed on the local scope of each template instance, including:
 *
 * | Variable  | Type            | Details                                                                     |
 * |-----------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `$index`  | {@type number}  | iterator offset of the repeated element (0..length-1)                       |
 * | `$first`  | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is first in the iterator.                      |
 * | `$middle` | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is between the first and last in the iterator. |
 * | `$last`   | {@type boolean} | true if the repeated element is last in the iterator.                       |
 * | `$even`   | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is even (otherwise false).           |
 * | `$odd`    | {@type boolean} | true if the iterator position `$index` is odd (otherwise false).            |
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 *   Creating aliases for these properties is possible with {@link ng.directive:ngInit `ngInit`}.
 *   This may be useful when, for instance, nesting ngRepeats.
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * # Iterating over object properties
 *
 * It is possible to get `ngRepeat` to iterate over the properties of an object using the following
 * syntax:
 *
 * ```js
 * <div ng-repeat="(key, value) in myObj"> ... </div>
 * ```
 *
 * However, there are a few limitations compared to array iteration:
 *
 * - The JavaScript specification does not define the order of keys
 *   returned for an object, so Angular relies on the order returned by the browser
 *   when running `for key in myObj`. Browsers generally follow the strategy of providing
 *   keys in the order in which they were defined, although there are exceptions when keys are deleted
 *   and reinstated. See the
 *   [MDN page on `delete` for more info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete#Cross-browser_notes).
 *
 * - `ngRepeat` will silently *ignore* object keys starting with `$`, because
 *   it's a prefix used by Angular for public (`$`) and private (`$$`) properties.
 *
 * - The built-in filters {@link ng.orderBy orderBy} and {@link ng.filter filter} do not work with
 *   objects, and will throw an error if used with one.
 *
 * If you are hitting any of these limitations, the recommended workaround is to convert your object into an array
 * that is sorted into the order that you prefer before providing it to `ngRepeat`. You could
 * do this with a filter such as [toArrayFilter](http://ngmodules.org/modules/angular-toArrayFilter)
 * or implement a `$watch` on the object yourself.
 *
 *
 * # Tracking and Duplicates
 *
 * `ngRepeat` uses {@link $rootScope.Scope#$watchCollection $watchCollection} to detect changes in
 * the collection. When a change happens, `ngRepeat` then makes the corresponding changes to the DOM:
 *
 * * When an item is added, a new instance of the template is added to the DOM.
 * * When an item is removed, its template instance is removed from the DOM.
 * * When items are reordered, their respective templates are reordered in the DOM.
 *
 * To minimize creation of DOM elements, `ngRepeat` uses a function
 * to "keep track" of all items in the collection and their corresponding DOM elements.
 * For example, if an item is added to the collection, `ngRepeat` will know that all other items
 * already have DOM elements, and will not re-render them.
 *
 * The default tracking function (which tracks items by their identity) does not allow
 * duplicate items in arrays. This is because when there are duplicates, it is not possible
 * to maintain a one-to-one mapping between collection items and DOM elements.
 *
 * If you do need to repeat duplicate items, you can substitute the default tracking behavior
 * with your own using the `track by` expression.
 *
 * For example, you may track items by the index of each item in the collection, using the
 * special scope property `$index`:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by $index">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * You may also use arbitrary expressions in `track by`, including references to custom functions
 * on the scope:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="n in [42, 42, 43, 43] track by myTrackingFunction(n)">
 *      {{n}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-success">
 * If you are working with objects that have a unique identifier property, you should track
 * by this identifier instead of the object instance. Should you reload your data later, `ngRepeat`
 * will not have to rebuild the DOM elements for items it has already rendered, even if the
 * JavaScript objects in the collection have been substituted for new ones. For large collections,
 * this significantly improves rendering performance. If you don't have a unique identifier,
 * `track by $index` can also provide a performance boost.
 * </div>
 *
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="model in collection track by model.id">
 *      {{model.name}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * <br />
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Avoid using `track by $index` when the repeated template contains
 * {@link guide/expression#one-time-binding one-time bindings}. In such cases, the `nth` DOM
 * element will always be matched with the `nth` item of the array, so the bindings on that element
 * will not be updated even when the corresponding item changes, essentially causing the view to get
 * out-of-sync with the underlying data.
 * </div>
 *
 * When no `track by` expression is provided, it is equivalent to tracking by the built-in
 * `$id` function, which tracks items by their identity:
 * ```html
 *    <div ng-repeat="obj in collection track by $id(obj)">
 *      {{obj.prop}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 * <br />
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * **Note:** `track by` must always be the last expression:
 * </div>
 * ```
 *    <div ng-repeat="model in collection | orderBy: 'id' as filtered_result track by model.id">
 *      {{model.name}}
 *    </div>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * # Special repeat start and end points
 * To repeat a series of elements instead of just one parent element, ngRepeat (as well as other ng directives) supports extending
 * the range of the repeater by defining explicit start and end points by using **ng-repeat-start** and **ng-repeat-end** respectively.
 * The **ng-repeat-start** directive works the same as **ng-repeat**, but will repeat all the HTML code (including the tag it's defined on)
 * up to and including the ending HTML tag where **ng-repeat-end** is placed.
 *
 * The example below makes use of this feature:
 * ```html
 *   <header ng-repeat-start="item in items">
 *     Header {{ item }}
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body {{ item }}
 *   </div>
 *   <footer ng-repeat-end>
 *     Footer {{ item }}
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * And with an input of {@type ['A','B']} for the items variable in the example above, the output will evaluate to:
 * ```html
 *   <header>
 *     Header A
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body A
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer A
 *   </footer>
 *   <header>
 *     Header B
 *   </header>
 *   <div class="body">
 *     Body B
 *   </div>
 *   <footer>
 *     Footer B
 *   </footer>
 * ```
 *
 * The custom start and end points for ngRepeat also support all other HTML directive syntax flavors provided in AngularJS (such
 * as **data-ng-repeat-start**, **x-ng-repeat-start** and **ng:repeat-start**).
 *
 * @animations
 * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |
 * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter} | when a new item is added to the list or when an item is revealed after a filter |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave} | when an item is removed from the list or when an item is filtered out |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#move move } | when an adjacent item is filtered out causing a reorder or when the item contents are reordered |
 *
 * See the example below for defining CSS animations with ngRepeat.
 *
 * @element ANY
 * @scope
 * @priority 1000
 * @param {repeat_expression} ngRepeat The expression indicating how to enumerate a collection. These
 *   formats are currently supported:
 *
 *   * `variable in expression` – where variable is the user defined loop variable and `expression`
 *     is a scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `album in artist.albums`.
 *
 *   * `(key, value) in expression` – where `key` and `value` can be any user defined identifiers,
 *     and `expression` is the scope expression giving the collection to enumerate.
 *
 *     For example: `(name, age) in {'adam':10, 'amalie':12}`.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression track by tracking_expression` – You can also provide an optional tracking expression
 *     which can be used to associate the objects in the collection with the DOM elements. If no tracking expression
 *     is specified, ng-repeat associates elements by identity. It is an error to have
 *     more than one tracking expression value resolve to the same key. (This would mean that two distinct objects are
 *     mapped to the same DOM element, which is not possible.)
 *
 *     Note that the tracking expression must come last, after any filters, and the alias expression.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items` is equivalent to `item in items track by $id(item)`. This implies that the DOM elements
 *     will be associated by item identity in the array.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by $id(item)`. A built in `$id()` function can be used to assign a unique
 *     `$$hashKey` property to each item in the array. This property is then used as a key to associated DOM elements
 *     with the corresponding item in the array by identity. Moving the same object in array would move the DOM
 *     element in the same way in the DOM.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items track by item.id` is a typical pattern when the items come from the database. In this
 *     case the object identity does not matter. Two objects are considered equivalent as long as their `id`
 *     property is same.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:searchText track by item.id` is a pattern that might be used to apply a filter
 *     to items in conjunction with a tracking expression.
 *
 *   * `variable in expression as alias_expression` – You can also provide an optional alias expression which will then store the
 *     intermediate results of the repeater after the filters have been applied. Typically this is used to render a special message
 *     when a filter is active on the repeater, but the filtered result set is empty.
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter:x as results` will store the fragment of the repeated items as `results`, but only after
 *     the items have been processed through the filter.
 *
 *     Please note that `as [variable name] is not an operator but rather a part of ngRepeat micro-syntax so it can be used only at the end
 *     (and not as operator, inside an expression).
 *
 *     For example: `item in items | filter : x | orderBy : order | limitTo : limit as results` .
 *
 * @example
 * This example uses `ngRepeat` to display a list of people. A filter is used to restrict the displayed
 * results by name or by age. New (entering) and removed (leaving) items are animated.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngShow
 * @multiElement
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngShow` directive shows or hides the given HTML element based on the expression provided to
 * the `ngShow` attribute.
 *
 * The element is shown or hidden by removing or adding the `.ng-hide` CSS class onto the element.
 * The `.ng-hide` CSS class is predefined in AngularJS and sets the display style to none (using an
 * `!important` flag). For CSP mode please add `angular-csp.css` to your HTML file (see
 * {@link ng.directive:ngCsp ngCsp}).
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is truthy (element is visible) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue"></div>
 *
 * <!-- when $scope.myValue is falsy (element is hidden) -->
 * <div ng-show="myValue" class="ng-hide"></div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `ngShow` expression evaluates to a falsy value then the `.ng-hide` CSS class is added
 * to the class attribute on the element causing it to become hidden. When truthy, the `.ng-hide`
 * CSS class is removed from the element causing the element not to appear hidden.
 *
 * ## Why is `!important` used?
 *
 * You may be wondering why `!important` is used for the `.ng-hide` CSS class. This is because the
 * `.ng-hide` selector can be easily overridden by heavier selectors. For example, something as
 * simple as changing the display style on a HTML list item would make hidden elements appear
 * visible. This also becomes a bigger issue when dealing with CSS frameworks.
 *
 * By using `!important`, the show and hide behavior will work as expected despite any clash between
 * CSS selector specificity (when `!important` isn't used with any conflicting styles). If a
 * developer chooses to override the styling to change how to hide an element then it is just a
 * matter of using `!important` in their own CSS code.
 *
 * ### Overriding `.ng-hide`
 *
 * By default, the `.ng-hide` class will style the element with `display: none !important`. If you
 * wish to change the hide behavior with `ngShow`/`ngHide`, you can simply overwrite the styles for
 * the `.ng-hide` CSS class. Note that the selector that needs to be used is actually
 * `.ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate)` to cope with extra animation classes that can be added.
 *
 * ```css
 * .ng-hide:not(.ng-hide-animate) {
 *   /&#42; These are just alternative ways of hiding an element &#42;/
 *   display: block!important;
 *   position: absolute;
 *   top: -9999px;
 *   left: -9999px;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * By default you don't need to override anything in CSS and the animations will work around the
 * display style.
 *
 * ## A note about animations with `ngShow`
 *
 * Animations in `ngShow`/`ngHide` work with the show and hide events that are triggered when the
 * directive expression is true and false. This system works like the animation system present with
 * `ngClass` except that you must also include the `!important` flag to override the display
 * property so that the elements are not actually hidden during the animation.
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; A working example can be found at the bottom of this page. &#42;/
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add, .my-element.ng-hide-remove {
 *   transition: all 0.5s linear;
 * }
 *
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-add.ng-hide-add-active { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove { ... }
 * .my-element.ng-hide-remove.ng-hide-remove-active { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, as of AngularJS version 1.3, there is no need to change the display property
 * to block during animation states - ngAnimate will automatically handle the style toggling for you.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngSwitch
 * @restrict EA
 *
 * @description
 * The `ngSwitch` directive is used to conditionally swap DOM structure on your template based on a scope expression.
 * Elements within `ngSwitch` but without `ngSwitchWhen` or `ngSwitchDefault` directives will be preserved at the location
 * as specified in the template.
 *
 * The directive itself works similar to ngInclude, however, instead of downloading template code (or loading it
 * from the template cache), `ngSwitch` simply chooses one of the nested elements and makes it visible based on which element
 * matches the value obtained from the evaluated expression. In other words, you define a container element
 * (where you place the directive), place an expression on the **`on="..."` attribute**
 * (or the **`ng-switch="..."` attribute**), define any inner elements inside of the directive and place
 * a when attribute per element. The when attribute is used to inform ngSwitch which element to display when the on
 * expression is evaluated. If a matching expression is not found via a when attribute then an element with the default
 * attribute is displayed.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * Be aware that the attribute values to match against cannot be expressions. They are interpreted
 * as literal string values to match against.
 * For example, **`ng-switch-when="someVal"`** will match against the string `"someVal"` not against the
 * value of the expression `$scope.someVal`.
 * </div>

 * @animations
 * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |
 * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter}  | after the ngSwitch contents change and the matched child element is placed inside the container |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave}  | after the ngSwitch contents change and just before the former contents are removed from the DOM |
 *
 * @usage
 *
 * ```
 * <ANY ng-switch="expression">
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue1">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-when="matchValue2">...</ANY>
 *   <ANY ng-switch-default>...</ANY>
 * </ANY>
 * ```
 *
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 1200
 * @param {*} ngSwitch|on expression to match against <code>ng-switch-when</code>.
 * On child elements add:
 *
 * * `ngSwitchWhen`: the case statement to match against. If match then this
 *   case will be displayed. If the same match appears multiple times, all the
 *   elements will be displayed. It is possible to associate multiple values to
 *   the same `ngSwitchWhen` by defining the optional attribute
 *   `ngSwitchWhenSeparator`. The separator will be used to split the value of
 *   the `ngSwitchWhen` attribute into multiple tokens, and the element will show
 *   if any of the `ngSwitch` evaluates to any of these tokens.
 * * `ngSwitchDefault`: the default case when no other case match. If there
 *   are multiple default cases, all of them will be displayed when no other
 *   case match.

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngTransclude
 * @restrict EAC
 *
 * @description
 * Directive that marks the insertion point for the transcluded DOM of the nearest parent directive that uses transclusion.
 *
 * You can specify that you want to insert a named transclusion slot, instead of the default slot, by providing the slot name
 * as the value of the `ng-transclude` or `ng-transclude-slot` attribute.
 *
 * If the transcluded content is not empty (i.e. contains one or more DOM nodes, including whitespace text nodes), any existing
 * content of this element will be removed before the transcluded content is inserted.
 * If the transcluded content is empty, the existing content is left intact. This lets you provide fallback content in the case
 * that no transcluded content is provided.
 *
 * @element ANY
 *
 * @param {string} ngTransclude|ngTranscludeSlot the name of the slot to insert at this point. If this is not provided, is empty
 *                                               or its value is the same as the name of the attribute then the default slot is used.
 *
 * @example
 * ### Basic transclusion

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name select
 * @restrict E
 *
 * @description
 * HTML `SELECT` element with angular data-binding.
 *
 * The `select` directive is used together with {@link ngModel `ngModel`} to provide data-binding
 * between the scope and the `<select>` control (including setting default values).
 * It also handles dynamic `<option>` elements, which can be added using the {@link ngRepeat `ngRepeat}` or
 * {@link ngOptions `ngOptions`} directives.
 *
 * When an item in the `<select>` menu is selected, the value of the selected option will be bound
 * to the model identified by the `ngModel` directive. With static or repeated options, this is
 * the content of the `value` attribute or the textContent of the `<option>`, if the value attribute is missing.
 * For dynamic options, use interpolation inside the `value` attribute or the `textContent`. Using
 * {@link ngValue ngValue} is also possible (as it sets the `value` attribute), and will take
 * precedence over `value` and `textContent`.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-warning">
 * Note that the value of a `select` directive used without `ngOptions` is always a string.
 * When the model needs to be bound to a non-string value, you must either explicitly convert it
 * using a directive (see example below) or use `ngOptions` to specify the set of options.
 * This is because an option element can only be bound to string values at present.
 * </div>
 *
 * If the viewValue of `ngModel` does not match any of the options, then the control
 * will automatically add an "unknown" option, which it then removes when the mismatch is resolved.
 *
 * Optionally, a single hard-coded `<option>` element, with the value set to an empty string, can
 * be nested into the `<select>` element. This element will then represent the `null` or "not selected"
 * option. See example below for demonstration.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * In many cases, `ngRepeat` can be used on `<option>` elements instead of {@link ng.directive:ngOptions
 * ngOptions} to achieve a similar result. However, `ngOptions` provides some benefits, such as
 * more flexibility in how the `<select>`'s model is assigned via the `select` **`as`** part of the
 * comprehension expression, and additionally in reducing memory and increasing speed by not creating
 * a new scope for each repeated instance.
 * </div>
 *
 *
 * @param {string} ngModel Assignable angular expression to data-bind to.
 * @param {string=} name Property name of the form under which the control is published.
 * @param {string=} multiple Allows multiple options to be selected. The selected values will be
 *     bound to the model as an array.
 * @param {string=} required Sets `required` validation error key if the value is not entered.
 * @param {string=} ngRequired Adds required attribute and required validation constraint to
 * the element when the ngRequired expression evaluates to true. Use ngRequired instead of required
 * when you want to data-bind to the required attribute.
 * @param {string=} ngChange Angular expression to be executed when selected option(s) changes due to user
 *    interaction with the select element.
 * @param {string=} ngOptions sets the options that the select is populated with and defines what is
 * set on the model on selection. See {@link ngOptions `ngOptions`}.
 *

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngRequired
 * @restrict A
 *
 * @description
 *
 * ngRequired adds the required {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `validator`} to {@link ngModel `ngModel`}.
 * It is most often used for {@link input `input`} and {@link select `select`} controls, but can also be
 * applied to custom controls.
 *
 * The directive sets the `required` attribute on the element if the Angular expression inside
 * `ngRequired` evaluates to true. A special directive for setting `required` is necessary because we
 * cannot use interpolation inside `required`. See the {@link guide/interpolation interpolation guide}
 * for more info.
 *
 * The validator will set the `required` error key to true if the `required` attribute is set and
 * calling {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$isEmpty `NgModelController.$isEmpty`} with the
 * {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue `ngModel.$viewValue`} returns `true`. For example, the
 * `$isEmpty()` implementation for `input[text]` checks the length of the `$viewValue`. When developing
 * custom controls, `$isEmpty()` can be overwritten to account for a $viewValue that is not string-based.
 *

 * ngPattern adds the pattern {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$validators `validator`} to {@link ngModel `ngModel`}.
 * It is most often used for text-based {@link input `input`} controls, but can also be applied to custom text-based controls.
 *
 * The validator sets the `pattern` error key if the {@link ngModel.NgModelController#$viewValue `ngModel.$viewValue`}
 * does not match a RegExp which is obtained by evaluating the Angular expression given in the
 * `ngPattern` attribute value:
 * * If the expression evaluates to a RegExp object, then this is used directly.
 * * If the expression evaluates to a string, then it will be converted to a RegExp after wrapping it
 * in `^` and `$` characters. For instance, `"abc"` will be converted to `new RegExp('^abc$')`.
 *
 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Note:** Avoid using the `g` flag on the RegExp, as it will cause each successive search to
 * start at the index of the last search's match, thus not taking the whole input value into
 * account.
 * </div>

 * <div class="alert alert-info">
 * **Note:** This directive is also added when the plain `pattern` attribute is used, with two
 * differences:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *     `ngPattern` does not set the `pattern` attribute and therefore HTML5 constraint validation is
 *     not available.

   *    `$location.path` will be updated to add or drop the trailing slash to exactly match the
   *    route definition.
   *
   *    * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon: e.g. `:name`. All characters up
   *        to the next slash are matched and stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`
   *        when the route matches.
   *    * `path` can contain named groups starting with a colon and ending with a star:
   *        e.g.`:name*`. All characters are eagerly stored in `$routeParams` under the given `name`
   *        when the route matches.
   *    * `path` can contain optional named groups with a question mark: e.g.`:name?`.
   *
   *    For example, routes like `/color/:color/largecode/:largecode*\/edit` will match
   *    `/color/brown/largecode/code/with/slashes/edit` and extract:
   *
   *    * `color: brown`
   *    * `largecode: code/with/slashes`.
   *
   *
   * @param {Object} route Mapping information to be assigned to `$route.current` on route
   *    match.
   *
   *    Object properties:
   *
   *    - `controller` – `{(string|function()=}` – Controller fn that should be associated with
   *      newly created scope or the name of a {@link angular.Module#controller registered
   *      controller} if passed as a string.
   *    - `controllerAs` – `{string=}` – An identifier name for a reference to the controller.
   *      If present, the controller will be published to scope under the `controllerAs` name.
   *    - `template` – `{string=|function()=}` – html template as a string or a function that
   *      returns an html template as a string which should be used by {@link
   *      ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView} or {@link ng.directive:ngInclude ngInclude} directives.
   *      This property takes precedence over `templateUrl`.
   *
   *      If `template` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `templateUrl` – `{string=|function()=}` – path or function that returns a path to an html
   *      template that should be used by {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView ngView}.
   *
   *      If `templateUrl` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Array.<Object>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route
   *
   *    - `resolve` - `{Object.<string, function>=}` - An optional map of dependencies which should
   *      be injected into the controller. If any of these dependencies are promises, the router
   *      will wait for them all to be resolved or one to be rejected before the controller is
   *      instantiated.
   *      If all the promises are resolved successfully, the values of the resolved promises are
   *      injected and {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeSuccess $routeChangeSuccess} event is
   *      fired. If any of the promises are rejected the
   *      {@link ngRoute.$route#$routeChangeError $routeChangeError} event is fired.
   *      For easier access to the resolved dependencies from the template, the `resolve` map will
   *      be available on the scope of the route, under `$resolve` (by default) or a custom name
   *      specified by the `resolveAs` property (see below). This can be particularly useful, when
   *      working with {@link angular.Module#component components} as route templates.<br />
   *      <div class="alert alert-warning">
   *        **Note:** If your scope already contains a property with this name, it will be hidden
   *        or overwritten. Make sure, you specify an appropriate name for this property, that
   *        does not collide with other properties on the scope.
   *      </div>
   *      The map object is:
   *
   *      - `key` – `{string}`: a name of a dependency to be injected into the controller.
   *      - `factory` - `{string|function}`: If `string` then it is an alias for a service.
   *        Otherwise if function, then it is {@link auto.$injector#invoke injected}
   *        and the return value is treated as the dependency. If the result is a promise, it is
   *        resolved before its value is injected into the controller. Be aware that
   *        `ngRoute.$routeParams` will still refer to the previous route within these resolve
   *        functions.  Use `$route.current.params` to access the new route parameters, instead.
   *
   *    - `resolveAs` - `{string=}` - The name under which the `resolve` map will be available on
   *      the scope of the route. If omitted, defaults to `$resolve`.
   *
   *    - `redirectTo` – `{(string|function())=}` – value to update
   *      {@link ng.$location $location} path with and trigger route redirection.
   *
   *      If `redirectTo` is a function, it will be called with the following parameters:
   *
   *      - `{Object.<string>}` - route parameters extracted from the current
   *        `$location.path()` by applying the current route templateUrl.
   *      - `{string}` - current `$location.path()`
   *      - `{Object}` - current `$location.search()`
   *
   *      The custom `redirectTo` function is expected to return a string which will be used
   *      to update `$location.path()` and `$location.search()`.
   *
   *    - `[reloadOnSearch=true]` - `{boolean=}` - reload route when only `$location.search()`
   *      or `$location.hash()` changes.
   *
   *      If the option is set to `false` and url in the browser changes, then
   *      `$routeUpdate` event is broadcasted on the root scope.
   *
   *    - `[caseInsensitiveMatch=false]` - `{boolean=}` - match routes without being case sensitive
   *
   *      If the option is set to `true`, then the particular route can be matched without being
   *      case sensitive
   *

     * The route definition contains:
     *
     *   - `controller`: The controller constructor as defined in the route definition.
     *   - `locals`: A map of locals which is used by {@link ng.$controller $controller} service for
     *     controller instantiation. The `locals` contain
     *     the resolved values of the `resolve` map. Additionally the `locals` also contain:
     *
     *     - `$scope` - The current route scope.
     *     - `$template` - The current route template HTML.
     *
     *     The `locals` will be assigned to the route scope's `$resolve` property. You can override
     *     the property name, using `resolveAs` in the route definition. See
     *     {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider} for more info.

     * @property {Object} routes Object with all route configuration Objects as its properties.
     *
     * @description
     * `$route` is used for deep-linking URLs to controllers and views (HTML partials).
     * It watches `$location.url()` and tries to map the path to an existing route definition.
     *
     * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
     *
     * You can define routes through {@link ngRoute.$routeProvider $routeProvider}'s API.
     *
     * The `$route` service is typically used in conjunction with the
     * {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView `ngView`} directive and the
     * {@link ngRoute.$routeParams `$routeParams`} service.
     *
     * @example
     * This example shows how changing the URL hash causes the `$route` to match a route against the
     * URL, and the `ngView` pulls in the partial.

 * @ngdoc service

 *
 * @description
 * The `$routeParams` service allows you to retrieve the current set of route parameters.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
 *
 * The route parameters are a combination of {@link ng.$location `$location`}'s
 * {@link ng.$location#search `search()`} and {@link ng.$location#path `path()`}.
 * The `path` parameters are extracted when the {@link ngRoute.$route `$route`} path is matched.
 *
 * In case of parameter name collision, `path` params take precedence over `search` params.
 *
 * The service guarantees that the identity of the `$routeParams` object will remain unchanged
 * (but its properties will likely change) even when a route change occurs.
 *
 * Note that the `$routeParams` are only updated *after* a route change completes successfully.
 * This means that you cannot rely on `$routeParams` being correct in route resolve functions.
 * Instead you can use `$route.current.params` to access the new route's parameters.
 *
 * @example
 * ```js
 *  // Given:
 *  // URL: http://server.com/index.html#/Chapter/1/Section/2?search=moby
 *  // Route: /Chapter/:chapterId/Section/:sectionId
 *  //
 *  // Then
 *  $routeParams ==> {chapterId:'1', sectionId:'2', search:'moby'}
 * ```

/**
 * @ngdoc directive
 * @name ngView
 * @restrict ECA
 *
 * @description
 * # Overview
 * `ngView` is a directive that complements the {@link ngRoute.$route $route} service by
 * including the rendered template of the current route into the main layout (`index.html`) file.
 * Every time the current route changes, the included view changes with it according to the
 * configuration of the `$route` service.
 *
 * Requires the {@link ngRoute `ngRoute`} module to be installed.
 *
 * @animations
 * | Animation                        | Occurs                              |
 * |----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.$animate#enter enter}  | when the new element is inserted to the DOM |
 * | {@link ng.$animate#leave leave}  | when the old element is removed from to the DOM  |
 *
 * The enter and leave animation occur concurrently.
 *
 * @knownIssue If `ngView` is contained in an asynchronously loaded template (e.g. in another
 *             directive's templateUrl or in a template loaded using `ngInclude`), then you need to
 *             make sure that `$route` is instantiated in time to capture the initial
 *             `$locationChangeStart` event and load the appropriate view. One way to achieve this
 *             is to have it as a dependency in a `.run` block:
 *             `myModule.run(['$route', function() {}]);`
 *
 * @scope
 * @priority 400
 * @param {string=} onload Expression to evaluate whenever the view updates.
 *
 * @param {string=} autoscroll Whether `ngView` should call {@link ng.$anchorScroll
 *                  $anchorScroll} to scroll the viewport after the view is updated.
 *
 *                  - If the attribute is not set, disable scrolling.
 *                  - If the attribute is set without value, enable scrolling.
 *                  - Otherwise enable scrolling only if the `autoscroll` attribute value evaluated
 *                    as an expression yields a truthy value.

/**
 * @ngdoc service
 * @name $animateCss
 * @kind object
 *
 * @description
 * The `$animateCss` service is a useful utility to trigger customized CSS-based transitions/keyframes
 * from a JavaScript-based animation or directly from a directive. The purpose of `$animateCss` is NOT
 * to side-step how `$animate` and ngAnimate work, but the goal is to allow pre-existing animations or
 * directives to create more complex animations that can be purely driven using CSS code.
 *
 * Note that only browsers that support CSS transitions and/or keyframe animations are capable of
 * rendering animations triggered via `$animateCss` (bad news for IE9 and lower).
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Once again, `$animateCss` is designed to be used inside of a registered JavaScript animation that
 * is powered by ngAnimate. It is possible to use `$animateCss` directly inside of a directive, however,
 * any automatic control over cancelling animations and/or preventing animations from being run on
 * child elements will not be handled by Angular. For this to work as expected, please use `$animate` to
 * trigger the animation and then setup a JavaScript animation that injects `$animateCss` to trigger
 * the CSS animation.
 *
 * The example below shows how we can create a folding animation on an element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- notice the `fold-animation` CSS class -->
 * <div ng-if="onOff" class="fold-animation">
 *   This element will go BOOM
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=true">Fold In</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Now we create the **JavaScript animation** that will trigger the CSS transition:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## More Advanced Uses
 *
 * `$animateCss` is the underlying code that ngAnimate uses to power **CSS-based animations** behind the scenes. Therefore CSS hooks
 * like `.ng-EVENT`, `.ng-EVENT-active`, `.ng-EVENT-stagger` are all features that can be triggered using `$animateCss` via JavaScript code.
 *
 * This also means that just about any combination of adding classes, removing classes, setting styles, dynamically setting a keyframe animation,
 * applying a hardcoded duration or delay value, changing the animation easing or applying a stagger animation are all options that work with
 * `$animateCss`. The service itself is smart enough to figure out the combination of options and examine the element styling properties in order
 * to provide a working animation that will run in CSS.
 *
 * The example below showcases a more advanced version of the `.fold-animation` from the example above:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.animation('.fold-animation', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       var height = element[0].offsetHeight;
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         addClass: 'red large-text pulse-twice',
 *         easing: 'ease-out',
 *         from: { height:'0px' },
 *         to: { height:height + 'px' },
 *         duration: 1 // one second
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Since we're adding/removing CSS classes then the CSS transition will also pick those up:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; since a hardcoded duration value of 1 was provided in the JavaScript animation code,
 * the CSS classes below will be transitioned despite them being defined as regular CSS classes &#42;/
 * .red { background:red; }
 * .large-text { font-size:20px; }
 *
 * /&#42; we can also use a keyframe animation and $animateCss will make it work alongside the transition &#42;/
 * .pulse-twice {
 *   animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 *   -webkit-animation: 0.5s pulse linear 2;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes pulse {
 *   from { transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes pulse {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: scale(0.5); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: scale(1.5); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Given this complex combination of CSS classes, styles and options, `$animateCss` will figure everything out and make the animation happen.
 *
 * ## How the Options are handled
 *
 * `$animateCss` is very versatile and intelligent when it comes to figuring out what configurations to apply to the element to ensure the animation
 * works with the options provided. Say for example we were adding a class that contained a keyframe value and we wanted to also animate some inline
 * styles using the `from` and `to` properties.
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, {
 *   from: { background:'red' },
 *   to: { background:'blue' }
 * });
 * animator.start();
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .rotating-animation {
 *   animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 *   -webkit-animation:0.5s rotate linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes rotate {
 *   from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes rotate {
 *   from { -webkit-transform: rotate(0deg); }
 *   to { -webkit-transform: rotate(360deg); }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The missing pieces here are that we do not have a transition set (within the CSS code nor within the `$animateCss` options) and the duration of the animation is
 * going to be detected from what the keyframe styles on the CSS class are. In this event, `$animateCss` will automatically create an inline transition
 * style matching the duration detected from the keyframe style (which is present in the CSS class that is being added) and then prepare both the transition
 * and keyframe animations to run in parallel on the element. Then when the animation is underway the provided `from` and `to` CSS styles will be applied
 * and spread across the transition and keyframe animation.
 *
 * ## What is returned
 *
 * `$animateCss` works in two stages: a preparation phase and an animation phase. Therefore when `$animateCss` is first called it will NOT actually
 * start the animation. All that is going on here is that the element is being prepared for the animation (which means that the generated CSS classes are
 * added and removed on the element). Once `$animateCss` is called it will return an object with the following properties:
 *
 * ```js
 * var animator = $animateCss(element, { ... });
 * ```
 *
 * Now what do the contents of our `animator` variable look like:
 *
 * ```js
 * {
 *   // starts the animation
 *   start: Function,
 *
 *   // ends (aborts) the animation
 *   end: Function
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * To actually start the animation we need to run `animation.start()` which will then return a promise that we can hook into to detect when the animation ends.
 * If we choose not to run the animation then we MUST run `animation.end()` to perform a cleanup on the element (since some CSS classes and styles may have been
 * applied to the element during the preparation phase). Note that all other properties such as duration, delay, transitions and keyframes are just properties
 * and that changing them will not reconfigure the parameters of the animation.
 *
 * ### runner.done() vs runner.then()
 * It is documented that `animation.start()` will return a promise object and this is true, however, there is also an additional method available on the
 * runner called `.done(callbackFn)`. The done method works the same as `.finally(callbackFn)`, however, it does **not trigger a digest to occur**.
 * Therefore, for performance reasons, it's always best to use `runner.done(callback)` instead of `runner.then()`, `runner.catch()` or `runner.finally()`
 * unless you really need a digest to kick off afterwards.
 *
 * Keep in mind that, to make this easier, ngAnimate has tweaked the JS animations API to recognize when a runner instance is returned from $animateCss
 * (so there is no need to call `runner.done(doneFn)` inside of your JavaScript animation code).
 * Check the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss#usage animation code above} to see how this works.
 *
 * @param {DOMElement} element the element that will be animated
 * @param {object} options the animation-related options that will be applied during the animation
 *
 * * `event` - The DOM event (e.g. enter, leave, move). When used, a generated CSS class of `ng-EVENT` and `ng-EVENT-active` will be applied
 * to the element during the animation. Multiple events can be provided when spaces are used as a separator. (Note that this will not perform any DOM operation.)
 * * `structural` - Indicates that the `ng-` prefix will be added to the event class. Setting to `false` or omitting will turn `ng-EVENT` and
 * `ng-EVENT-active` in `EVENT` and `EVENT-active`. Unused if `event` is omitted.
 * * `easing` - The CSS easing value that will be applied to the transition or keyframe animation (or both).
 * * `transitionStyle` - The raw CSS transition style that will be used (e.g. `1s linear all`).
 * * `keyframeStyle` - The raw CSS keyframe animation style that will be used (e.g. `1s my_animation linear`).
 * * `from` - The starting CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied at the start of the animation.
 * * `to` - The ending CSS styles (a key/value object) that will be applied across the animation via a CSS transition.
 * * `addClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be added to the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `removeClass` - A space separated list of CSS classes that will be removed from the element and spread across the animation.
 * * `duration` - A number value representing the total duration of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `0`
 * is provided then the animation will be skipped entirely.
 * * `delay` - A number value representing the total delay of the transition and/or keyframe (note that a value of 1 is 1000ms). If a value of `true` is
 * used then whatever delay value is detected from the CSS classes will be mirrored on the elements styles (e.g. by setting delay true then the style value
 * of the element will be `transition-delay: DETECTED_VALUE`). Using `true` is useful when you want the CSS classes and inline styles to all share the same
 * CSS delay value.
 * * `stagger` - A numeric time value representing the delay between successively animated elements
 * ({@link ngAnimate#css-staggering-animations Click here to learn how CSS-based staggering works in ngAnimate.})
 * * `staggerIndex` - The numeric index representing the stagger item (e.g. a value of 5 is equal to the sixth item in the stagger; therefore when a
 *   `stagger` option value of `0.1` is used then there will be a stagger delay of `600ms`)
 * * `applyClassesEarly` - Whether or not the classes being added or removed will be used when detecting the animation. This is set by `$animate` when enter/leave/move animations are fired to ensure that the CSS classes are resolved in time. (Note that this will prevent any transitions from occurring on the classes being added and removed.)
 * * `cleanupStyles` - Whether or not the provided `from` and `to` styles will be removed once
 *    the animation is closed. This is useful for when the styles are used purely for the sake of
 *    the animation and do not have a lasting visual effect on the element (e.g. a collapse and open animation).
 *    By default this value is set to `false`.
 *
 * @return {object} an object with start and end methods and details about the animation.
 *
 * * `start` - The method to start the animation. This will return a `Promise` when called.
 * * `end` - This method will cancel the animation and remove all applied CSS classes and styles.

 * then the old image will perform a `leave` animation and the new element
 * will be inserted via an `enter` animation.

/**
 * @ngdoc module
 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for CSS-based animations (keyframes and transitions) as well as JavaScript-based animations via
 * callback hooks. Animations are not enabled by default, however, by including `ngAnimate` the animation hooks are enabled for an Angular app.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 * Simply put, there are two ways to make use of animations when ngAnimate is used: by using **CSS** and **JavaScript**. The former works purely based
 * using CSS (by using matching CSS selectors/styles) and the latter triggers animations that are registered via `module.animation()`. For
 * both CSS and JS animations the sole requirement is to have a matching `CSS class` that exists both in the registered animation and within
 * the HTML element that the animation will be triggered on.
 *
 * ## Directive Support
 * The following directives are "animation aware":
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |

 *
 * ## CSS-based Animations
 *
 * CSS-based animations with ngAnimate are unique since they require no JavaScript code at all. By using a CSS class that we reference between our HTML
 * and CSS code we can create an animation that will be picked up by Angular when an underlying directive performs an operation.
 *
 * The example below shows how an `enter` animation can be made possible on an element using `ng-if`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="fade">
 *    Fade me in out
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=true">Fade In!</button>
 * <button ng-click="bool=false">Fade Out!</button>
 * ```
 *
 * Notice the CSS class **fade**? We can now create the CSS transition code that references this class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; The starting CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42; The finishing CSS styles for the enter animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The key thing to remember here is that, depending on the animation event (which each of the directives above trigger depending on what's going on) two
 * generated CSS classes will be applied to the element; in the example above we have `.ng-enter` and `.ng-enter-active`. For CSS transitions, the transition
 * code **must** be defined within the starting CSS class (in this case `.ng-enter`). The destination class is what the transition will animate towards.
 *
 * If for example we wanted to create animations for `leave` and `move` (ngRepeat triggers move) then we can do so using the same CSS naming conventions:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; now the element will fade out before it is removed from the DOM &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of **CSS Keyframes** by referencing the keyframe animation within the starting CSS class:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; there is no need to define anything inside of the destination
 * CSS class since the keyframe will take charge of the animation &#42;/
 * .fade.ng-leave {
 *   animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 *   -webkit-animation: my_fade_animation 0.5s linear;
 * }
 *
 * @keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 *
 * @-webkit-keyframes my_fade_animation {
 *   from { opacity:1; }
 *   to { opacity:0; }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Feel free also mix transitions and keyframes together as well as any other CSS classes on the same element.
 *
 * ### CSS Class-based Animations
 *
 * Class-based animations (animations that are triggered via `ngClass`, `ngShow`, `ngHide` and some other directives) have a slightly different
 * naming convention. Class-based animations are basic enough that a standard transition or keyframe can be referenced on the class being added
 * and removed.
 *
 * For example if we wanted to do a CSS animation for `ngHide` then we place an animation on the `.ng-hide` CSS class:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-show="bool" class="fade">
 *   Show and hide me
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="bool=!bool">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .fade.ng-hide {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * All that is going on here with ngShow/ngHide behind the scenes is the `.ng-hide` class is added/removed (when the hidden state is valid). Since
 * ngShow and ngHide are animation aware then we can match up a transition and ngAnimate handles the rest.
 *
 * In addition the addition and removal of the CSS class, ngAnimate also provides two helper methods that we can use to further decorate the animation
 * with CSS styles.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="{on:onOff}" class="highlight">
 *   Highlight this box
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="onOff=!onOff">Toggle</button>
 *
 * <style>
 * .highlight {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-add {
 *   background:white;
 * }
 * .highlight.on {
 *   background:yellow;
 * }
 * .highlight.on-remove {
 *   background:black;
 * }
 * </style>
 * ```
 *
 * We can also make use of CSS keyframes by placing them within the CSS classes.
 *
 *
 * ### CSS Staggering Animations
 * A Staggering animation is a collection of animations that are issued with a slight delay in between each successive operation resulting in a
 * curtain-like effect. The ngAnimate module (versions >=1.2) supports staggering animations and the stagger effect can be
 * performed by creating a **ng-EVENT-stagger** CSS class and attaching that class to the base CSS class used for
 * the animation. The style property expected within the stagger class can either be a **transition-delay** or an
 * **animation-delay** property (or both if your animation contains both transitions and keyframe animations).
 *
 * ```css
 * .my-animation.ng-enter {
 *   /&#42; standard transition code &#42;/
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter-stagger {
 *   /&#42; this will have a 100ms delay between each successive leave animation &#42;/
 *   transition-delay: 0.1s;
 *
 *   /&#42; As of 1.4.4, this must always be set: it signals ngAnimate
 *     to not accidentally inherit a delay property from another CSS class &#42;/
 *   transition-duration: 0s;
 * }
 * .my-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   /&#42; standard transition styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Staggering animations work by default in ngRepeat (so long as the CSS class is defined). Outside of ngRepeat, to use staggering animations
 * on your own, they can be triggered by firing multiple calls to the same event on $animate. However, the restrictions surrounding this
 * are that each of the elements must have the same CSS className value as well as the same parent element. A stagger operation
 * will also be reset if one or more animation frames have passed since the multiple calls to `$animate` were fired.
 *
 * The following code will issue the **ng-leave-stagger** event on the element provided:
 *
 * ```js
 * var kids = parent.children();
 *
 * $animate.leave(kids[0]); //stagger index=0
 * $animate.leave(kids[1]); //stagger index=1
 * $animate.leave(kids[2]); //stagger index=2
 * $animate.leave(kids[3]); //stagger index=3
 * $animate.leave(kids[4]); //stagger index=4
 *
 * window.requestAnimationFrame(function() {
 *   //stagger has reset itself
 *   $animate.leave(kids[5]); //stagger index=0
 *   $animate.leave(kids[6]); //stagger index=1
 *
 *   $scope.$digest();
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Stagger animations are currently only supported within CSS-defined animations.
 *
 * ### The `ng-animate` CSS class
 *
 * When ngAnimate is animating an element it will apply the `ng-animate` CSS class to the element for the duration of the animation.
 * This is a temporary CSS class and it will be removed once the animation is over (for both JavaScript and CSS-based animations).
 *
 * Therefore, animations can be applied to an element using this temporary class directly via CSS.
 *
 * ```css
 * .zipper.ng-animate {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-enter {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-leave {
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .zipper.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that the `ng-animate` CSS class is reserved and it cannot be applied on an element directly since ngAnimate will always remove
 * the CSS class once an animation has completed.)
 *
 *
 * ### The `ng-[event]-prepare` class
 *
 * This is a special class that can be used to prevent unwanted flickering / flash of content before
 * the actual animation starts. The class is added as soon as an animation is initialized, but removed
 * before the actual animation starts (after waiting for a $digest).
 * It is also only added for *structural* animations (`enter`, `move`, and `leave`).
 *
 * In practice, flickering can appear when nesting elements with structural animations such as `ngIf`
 * into elements that have class-based animations such as `ngClass`.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="{red: myProp}">
 *   <div ng-class="{blue: myProp}">
 *     <div class="message" ng-if="myProp"></div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * It is possible that during the `enter` animation, the `.message` div will be briefly visible before it starts animating.
 * In that case, you can add styles to the CSS that make sure the element stays hidden before the animation starts:
 *
 * ```css
 * .message.ng-enter-prepare {
 *   opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * ```
 *
 * ## JavaScript-based Animations
 *
 * ngAnimate also allows for animations to be consumed by JavaScript code. The approach is similar to CSS-based animations (where there is a shared
 * CSS class that is referenced in our HTML code) but in addition we need to register the JavaScript animation on the module. By making use of the
 * `module.animation()` module function we can register the animation.
 *
 * Let's see an example of a enter/leave animation using `ngRepeat`:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-repeat="item in items" class="slide">
 *   {{ item }}
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * See the **slide** CSS class? Let's use that class to define an animation that we'll structure in our module code by using `module.animation`:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     // make note that other events (like addClass/removeClass)
 *     // have different function input parameters
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *
 *       // remember to call doneFn so that angular
 *       // knows that the animation has concluded
 *     },
 *
 *     move: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     },
 *
 *     leave: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).fadeOut(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing about JS-based animations is that we can inject other services and make use of advanced animation libraries such as
 * greensock.js and velocity.js.
 *
 * If our animation code class-based (meaning that something like `ngClass`, `ngHide` and `ngShow` triggers it) then we can still define
 * our animations inside of the same registered animation, however, the function input arguments are a bit different:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-class="color" class="colorful">
 *   this box is moody
 * </div>
 * <button ng-click="color='red'">Change to red</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='blue'">Change to blue</button>
 * <button ng-click="color='green'">Change to green</button>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.colorful', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     addClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     removeClass: function(element, className, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     },
 *     setClass: function(element, addedClass, removedClass, doneFn) {
 *       // do some cool animation and call the doneFn
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * ## CSS + JS Animations Together
 *
 * AngularJS 1.4 and higher has taken steps to make the amalgamation of CSS and JS animations more flexible. However, unlike earlier versions of Angular,
 * defining CSS and JS animations to work off of the same CSS class will not work anymore. Therefore the example below will only result in **JS animations taking
 * charge of the animation**:
 *
 * ```html
 * <div ng-if="bool" class="slide">
 *   Slide in and out
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', [function() {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element, doneFn) {
 *       jQuery(element).slideIn(1000, doneFn);
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * ```css
 * .slide.ng-enter {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transform:translateY(-100px);
 * }
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   transform:translateY(0);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Does this mean that CSS and JS animations cannot be used together? Do JS-based animations always have higher priority? We can make up for the
 * lack of CSS animations by using the `$animateCss` service to trigger our own tweaked-out, CSS-based animations directly from
 * our own JS-based animation code:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element) {
*        // this will trigger `.slide.ng-enter` and `.slide.ng-enter-active`.
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter',
 *         structural: true
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * The nice thing here is that we can save bandwidth by sticking to our CSS-based animation code and we don't need to rely on a 3rd-party animation framework.
 *
 * The `$animateCss` service is very powerful since we can feed in all kinds of extra properties that will be evaluated and fed into a CSS transition or
 * keyframe animation. For example if we wanted to animate the height of an element while adding and removing classes then we can do so by providing that
 * data into `$animateCss` directly:
 *
 * ```js
 * myModule.animation('.slide', ['$animateCss', function($animateCss) {
 *   return {
 *     enter: function(element) {
 *       return $animateCss(element, {
 *         event: 'enter',
 *         structural: true,
 *         addClass: 'maroon-setting',
 *         from: { height:0 },
 *         to: { height: 200 }
 *       });
 *     }
 *   }
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can fill in the rest via our transition CSS code:
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; the transition tells ngAnimate to make the animation happen &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter { transition:0.5s linear all; }
 *
 * /&#42; this extra CSS class will be absorbed into the transition
 * since the $animateCss code is adding the class &#42;/
 * .maroon-setting { background:red; }
 * ```
 *
 * And `$animateCss` will figure out the rest. Just make sure to have the `done()` callback fire the `doneFn` function to signal when the animation is over.
 *
 * To learn more about what's possible be sure to visit the {@link ngAnimate.$animateCss $animateCss service}.
 *
 * ## Animation Anchoring (via `ng-animate-ref`)
 *
 * ngAnimate in AngularJS 1.4 comes packed with the ability to cross-animate elements between
 * structural areas of an application (like views) by pairing up elements using an attribute
 * called `ng-animate-ref`.
 *
 * Let's say for example we have two views that are managed by `ng-view` and we want to show
 * that there is a relationship between two components situated in within these views. By using the
 * `ng-animate-ref` attribute we can identify that the two components are paired together and we
 * can then attach an animation, which is triggered when the view changes.
 *
 * Say for example we have the following template code:
 *
 * ```html
 * <!-- index.html -->
 * <div ng-view class="view-animation">
 * </div>
 *
 * <!-- home.html -->
 * <a href="#/banner-page">
 *   <img src="./banner.jpg" class="banner" ng-animate-ref="banner">
 * </a>
 *
 * <!-- banner-page.html -->
 * <img src="./banner.jpg" class="banner" ng-animate-ref="banner">
 * ```
 *
 * Now, when the view changes (once the link is clicked), ngAnimate will examine the
 * HTML contents to see if there is a match reference between any components in the view
 * that is leaving and the view that is entering. It will scan both the view which is being
 * removed (leave) and inserted (enter) to see if there are any paired DOM elements that
 * contain a matching ref value.
 *
 * The two images match since they share the same ref value. ngAnimate will now create a
 * transport element (which is a clone of the first image element) and it will then attempt
 * to animate to the position of the second image element in the next view. For the animation to
 * work a special CSS class called `ng-anchor` will be added to the transported element.
 *
 * We can now attach a transition onto the `.banner.ng-anchor` CSS class and then
 * ngAnimate will handle the entire transition for us as well as the addition and removal of
 * any changes of CSS classes between the elements:
 *
 * ```css
 * .banner.ng-anchor {
 *   /&#42; this animation will last for 1 second since there are
 *          two phases to the animation (an `in` and an `out` phase) &#42;/
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * We also **must** include animations for the views that are being entered and removed
 * (otherwise anchoring wouldn't be possible since the new view would be inserted right away).
 *
 * ```css
 * .view-animation.ng-enter, .view-animation.ng-leave {
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   position:fixed;
 *   left:0;
 *   top:0;
 *   width:100%;
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-enter {
 *   transform:translateX(100%);
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-leave,
 * .view-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *   transform:translateX(0%);
 * }
 * .view-animation.ng-leave.ng-leave-active {
 *   transform:translateX(-100%);
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Now we can jump back to the anchor animation. When the animation happens, there are two stages that occur:
 * an `out` and an `in` stage. The `out` stage happens first and that is when the element is animated away
 * from its origin. Once that animation is over then the `in` stage occurs which animates the
 * element to its destination. The reason why there are two animations is to give enough time
 * for the enter animation on the new element to be ready.
 *
 * The example above sets up a transition for both the in and out phases, but we can also target the out or
 * in phases directly via `ng-anchor-out` and `ng-anchor-in`.
 *
 * ```css
 * .banner.ng-anchor-out {
 *   transition: 0.5s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; the scale will be applied during the out animation,
 *          but will be animated away when the in animation runs &#42;/
 *   transform: scale(1.2);
 * }
 *
 * .banner.ng-anchor-in {
 *   transition: 1s linear all;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 *
 *

 *
 * ### How is the element transported?
 *
 * When an anchor animation occurs, ngAnimate will clone the starting element and position it exactly where the starting
 * element is located on screen via absolute positioning. The cloned element will be placed inside of the root element
 * of the application (where ng-app was defined) and all of the CSS classes of the starting element will be applied. The
 * element will then animate into the `out` and `in` animations and will eventually reach the coordinates and match
 * the dimensions of the destination element. During the entire animation a CSS class of `.ng-animate-shim` will be applied
 * to both the starting and destination elements in order to hide them from being visible (the CSS styling for the class
 * is: `visibility:hidden`). Once the anchor reaches its destination then it will be removed and the destination element
 * will become visible since the shim class will be removed.
 *
 * ### How is the morphing handled?
 *
 * CSS Anchoring relies on transitions and keyframes and the internal code is intelligent enough to figure out
 * what CSS classes differ between the starting element and the destination element. These different CSS classes
 * will be added/removed on the anchor element and a transition will be applied (the transition that is provided
 * in the anchor class). Long story short, ngAnimate will figure out what classes to add and remove which will
 * make the transition of the element as smooth and automatic as possible. Be sure to use simple CSS classes that
 * do not rely on DOM nesting structure so that the anchor element appears the same as the starting element (since
 * the cloned element is placed inside of root element which is likely close to the body element).
 *
 * Note that if the root element is on the `<html>` element then the cloned node will be placed inside of body.
 *
 *
 * ## Using $animate in your directive code
 *
 * So far we've explored how to feed in animations into an Angular application, but how do we trigger animations within our own directives in our application?
 * By injecting the `$animate` service into our directive code, we can trigger structural and class-based hooks which can then be consumed by animations. Let's
 * imagine we have a greeting box that shows and hides itself when the data changes
 *
 * ```html
 * <greeting-box active="onOrOff">Hi there</greeting-box>
 * ```
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.directive('greetingBox', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   return function(scope, element, attrs) {
 *     attrs.$observe('active', function(value) {
 *       value ? $animate.addClass(element, 'on') : $animate.removeClass(element, 'on');
 *     });
 *   });
 * }]);
 * ```
 *
 * Now the `on` CSS class is added and removed on the greeting box component. Now if we add a CSS class on top of the greeting box element
 * in our HTML code then we can trigger a CSS or JS animation to happen.
 *
 * ```css
 * /&#42; normally we would create a CSS class to reference on the element &#42;/
 * greeting-box.on { transition:0.5s linear all; background:green; color:white; }
 * ```
 *
 * The `$animate` service contains a variety of other methods like `enter`, `leave`, `animate` and `setClass`. To learn more about what's
 * possible be sure to visit the {@link ng.$animate $animate service API page}.
 *
 *
 * ## Callbacks and Promises
 *
 * When `$animate` is called it returns a promise that can be used to capture when the animation has ended. Therefore if we were to trigger
 * an animation (within our directive code) then we can continue performing directive and scope related activities after the animation has
 * ended by chaining onto the returned promise that animation method returns.
 *
 * ```js
 * // somewhere within the depths of the directive
 * $animate.enter(element, parent).then(function() {
 *   //the animation has completed
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that earlier versions of Angular prior to v1.4 required the promise code to be wrapped using `$scope.$apply(...)`. This is not the case
 * anymore.)
 *
 * In addition to the animation promise, we can also make use of animation-related callbacks within our directives and controller code by registering
 * an event listener using the `$animate` service. Let's say for example that an animation was triggered on our view
 * routing controller to hook into that:
 *
 * ```js
 * ngModule.controller('HomePageController', ['$animate', function($animate) {
 *   $animate.on('enter', ngViewElement, function(element) {
 *     // the animation for this route has completed
 *   }]);
 * }])
 * ```
 *
 * (Note that you will need to trigger a digest within the callback to get angular to notice any scope-related changes.)
